You can call the [EnableScalingGroup](~~25939~~) operation to enable a scaling group. You can trigger scaling events and execute scaling rules only in scaling groups that are in the Enabled state.\n\nIf you want to attach a Classic Load Balancer (CLB, formerly known as SLB) instance and an ApsaraDB RDS instance to the scaling group that you want to create, the scaling group, the CLB instance, and the ApsaraDB RDS instance must reside in the same region. For more information, see [Regions and zones](~~40654~~).\n\nIf you attach a CLB instance to the scaling group that you want to create, Auto Scaling automatically adds the ECS instances in the scaling group to the backend server groups of the CLB instance. You can specify the following types of server groups to add ECS instances:\n\n*   Default server group: ECS instances in this group process frontend requests. If no listeners are configured for vServer groups or primary/secondary server groups, the frontend requests are forwarded to the ECS instances in the default server group.\n*   vServer group: If you want to forward different requests to different backend servers, or you want to forward requests based on domain names or URLs, you can specify vServer groups.\n\n>  If you specify both the default server group and multiple server groups simultaneously, Auto Scaling adds the ECS instances in your scaling group to these server groups concurrently.\n\nThe default weight of each ECS instance as a backend server is 50. If you want to attach a CLB instance to the scaling group that you want to create, make sure that the CLB instance meets the following requirements:\n\n*   The CLB instance is in the Active state. You can call the [DescribeLoadBalancers](~~2401696~~) operation to query the status of CLB instances.\n*   Health check must be enabled on all listener ports configured for the CLB instance. Otherwise, the scaling group will fail to be created.\n\nIf you attach Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) server groups to the scaling group that you want to create, Auto Scaling adds the ECS instances in your scaling group to the ALB or NLB server groups to process the access requests forwarded by the corresponding ALB or NLB instances. You can attach multiple ALB or NLB server groups to a scaling group. Make sure that the ALB or NLB server groups belong to the same virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see [AttachAlbServerGroups](~~266800~~) or [AttachServerGroups](~~600535~~).\n\nIf you attach an ApsaraDB RDS instance to the scaling group that you want to create, Auto Scaling automatically adds the private IP addresses of the ECS instances in your scaling group to the IP address whitelist of the ApsaraDB RDS instance. Before you attach an ApsaraDB RDS instance to your scaling group, make sure that the ApsaraDB RDS instance meets the following requirements:\n\n*   The ApsaraDB RDS instance is in the Running state. You can call the [DescribeDBInstances](~~610396~~) state to query the status of ApsaraDB RDS instances.\n*   The number of IP addresses in the IP address whitelist of the ApsaraDB RDS instance does not reach its upper limit.

Tags that you add to the scaling group are propagated to only new instances.\n*   If you specify instance tags in the scaling configuration that is used to create instances and propagate the tags that you add to the scaling group to the instances, all tags exist at the same time.\n*   If the tag key that you specify in a scaling configuration and the tag key that you add to the scaling group of the scaling configuration are the same, the tag value that you specify in the scaling configuration is preferentially used.\n"},"ModifyScalingGroup":{"summary":"Modifies a scaling group.

The resources of the scaling groups are defined in Kubernetes Deployment YAML files. You can also call this operation to extend annotations for elastic container instances in Kubernetes Deployment YAML files. For more information, see \"Supported annotations\" in this topic.\n\nMapping between YAML files and scaling groups: You can map the triplet of namespace, kind, and name in a YAML file to a scaling group name. A YAML file and a scaling group have a one-to-one mapping relationship in a region. For example, if you use the Kubernetes Deployment YAML file whose name is NGINX in the default namespace to create a scaling group in a region, the unique name of the mapped scaling group is k8s\\_default\\_Deployment\\_nginx.\n\nYou can use a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file to manage a scaling group based on the following logic:\n\n* If an existing scaling group has a mapping relationship with your Kubernetes Deployment YAML file, you can update the scaling group by using the YAML file.\n* If no scaling group that has a mapping relationship with your Kubernetes Deployment YAML file exists, you can create a scaling group with ease by using the YAML file.\n\n1. If you do not specify a virtual private cloud (VPC), vSwitch, security group, or annotation in your Kubernetes Deployment YAML file, the system creates a default VPC that has default vSwitches and uses the default security group ess-default-sg of Auto Scaling. By default, the security group rule allows traffic on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)-based port 22 and port 3389 and enables Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for IPv4 addresses. If you want to enable other ports or protocols, you can create custom security group rules.\n2. If you want to use a public image, you must enable the Internet access feature and configure the k8s.aliyun.com/eci-with-eip pod annotation to enable the elastic IP address (EIP) feature.\n3. After you call the ApplyScalingGroup operation to apply a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file, the scaling group immediately enters the Enabled state and the scaling configuration immediately enters the Active state. If the number of replicas that you specified in the YAML file is grater than 0, elastic container instances are automatically created.\n\n### Supported annotations\n\nFor more information about annotations, see [ECI Pod Annotation](~~186939~~).\n\n|Annotation|Example|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|k8s.aliyun.com/ess-scaling-group-min-size|1|The minimum size of the scaling group that you want to create.

For example, you can use a scaling rule to define N instances to add or remove. If the execution of a scaling rule causes the total number of Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances or elastic container instances in the scaling group to drop below the value of MinSize or to exceed the value of MaxSize, Auto Scaling adjusts the number of instances to add or remove, which ensures that the total number of instances stays within the valid range. Take note that Auto Scaling does not adjust the number of instances that you defined in the scaling rule. Examples:\n\n*   The maximum number of instances (MaxSize) that can be contained in a scaling group is 3 and the current number of instances (Total Capacity) in the scaling group is 2. In this example, the Add3 scaling rule is created to add three ECS instances to the scaling group. However, after you execute Add3, Auto Scaling adds only one ECS instance to the scaling group. In addition, the number of ECS instances to add in the Add3 scaling rule remains unchanged.\n*   The minimum number of instances (MinSize) that must be contained in a scaling group is 2 and the current number of instances (Total Capacity) is 3. In this example, the Remove5 scaling rule is created to remove five ECS instances from the scaling group. However, after you execute Remove5, Auto Scaling only removes one ECS instance from the scaling group. In addition, the number of ECS instances to remove in the Remove5 scaling rule remains unchanged.\n\nBefore you call this operation, take note of the following items:\n\n*   If you set AdjustmentType to TotalCapacity, the total number of ECS instances or elastic container instances in your scaling group will be adjusted to a specified number when the scaling rule that you create by calling this operation is executed. You must set AdjustmentValue to an integer that is greater than 0.\n\n*   If you set AdjustmentType to QuantityChangeInCapacity or PercentChangeInCapacity, a positive value of AdjustmentValue specifies that a specific number of ECS instances or elastic container instances will be added to your scaling group, and a negative value of AdjustmentValue specifies that a specific number of ECS instances or elastic container instances will be removed from the scaling group.\n\n*   If you set AdjustmentType to PercentChangeInCapacity, Auto Scaling calculates the number of ECS instances or elastic container instances to add or remove by multiplying the current capacity of the scaling group (Total Capacity) by AdjustmentValue divided by 100, rounding off the result to determine the final adjustment count.\n\n*   If you specify a cooldown period for a scaling rule, the cooldown period of the scaling rule takes effect after you execute the scaling rule. If you do not specify a cooldown period for a scaling rule, the value of DefaultCooldown of the scaling group takes effect after you execute the scaling rule.\n\n*   You can create only a limited number of scaling rules for a scaling group. For more information, see [Limits](~~25863~~).\n\n*   The following API operations may use the unique identifier of a scaling rule (ScalingRuleAri) that is returned after you call the CreateScalingRule operation:\n\n    *   ExecuteScalingRule: You can call this operation to manually execute a scaling rule. In this operation, you can set ScalingRuleAri to the unique identifier of the scaling rule that you want to execute.\n    *   CreateScheduledTask: You can call this operation to create a scheduled task for a scaling rule.

Auto Scaling starts the new ECS instances before stopping the existing ECS instances. The rebalancing operation does not affect the performance or service availability of your application.\n\n*   This operation is supported by only multi-zone scaling groups whose `MultiAZPolicy` is set to `BALANCE`.\n\n*   A rebalancing operation is required only when the distribution of the instances of a multi-zone scaling group is significantly unbalanced. In a rebalancing activity, Auto Scaling replaces up to 20 ECS instances to rectify the unbalanced distribution.\n\n*   During the execution of a rebalancing operation, if the number of instances in the scaling group approaches or hits the value of MaxSize but the rebalancing operation needs to continue, Auto Scaling allows the total number of ECS instances to momentarily exceed the value of MaxSize by 10%. This temporary surplus condition persists for a duration until equilibrium in the distribution of ECS instances is achieved. Typically, it takes 1 to 6 minutes.\n\n    **\n\n    **Note** If the 10% increment of the maximum number of instances in a scaling group yield a non-integer value, the decimal portion is always rounded up to ensure an additional instance is accounted for. For example, you have a scaling group that holds a maximum of 15 ECS instances. During a rebalancing operation, Auto Scaling would permit the total number of instances to momentarily surpass this limit by 2, instead of the calculated 10% (which is 1.5).\n"},"SetInstanceHealth":{"summary":"Sets instance health.
