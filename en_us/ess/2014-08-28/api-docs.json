Go to [Quota Center](https://quotas.console.aliyun.com/products/ess/quotas) to check your quota of scaling groups.****\n\nA scaling group does not immediately take effect after you create the scaling group. You must call the [EnableScalingGroup](~~25939~~) operation to enable the scaling group. After you enable the scaling group, Auto Scaling can execute scaling rules to trigger scaling activities in the scaling group.\n\nThe Classic Load Balancer (CLB) instances and ApsaraDB RDS instances that you want to associate with a scaling group must reside in the same region as the scaling group. CLB instances are formerly known as Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances. For more information, see the [Regions and zones](~~40654~~) topic.\n\nIf you associate a CLB instance with a scaling group, Auto Scaling automatically adds ECS instances in the scaling group to the backend server groups of the associated CLB instance. You can specify a server group to which ECS instances can be added. You can add ECS instances to the following types of server groups:\n\n*   Default server group: a group of ECS instances that are used to receive requests. If you do not specify a vServer group or a primary/secondary server group for a listener, requests are forwarded to the ECS instances in the default server group.\n\n*   vServer group: If you want to forward requests to backend servers that are not in the default server group or configure domain name-based or URL-based forwarding rules, you can use vServer groups.\n\n    **\n\n    **Note** If you specify the default server group and multiple vServer groups at the same time, ECS instances are added to all the specified server groups.\n\n    The default weight of an ECS instance that is added as a backend server of a CLB instance is 50. The CLB instance that you want to associate with your scaling group must meet the following requirements:\n\n*   The CLB instance must be in the **Active **state. You can call the [DescribeLoadBalancers](~~27582~~) operation to query the status of the CLB instance.\n\n*   The health check feature must be enabled on all listener ports that are configured for the CLB instance. Otherwise, the scaling group cannot be created.\n\nIf you associated an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) server group with a scaling group, Auto Scaling automatically adds ECS instances in the scaling group to the ALB or NLB server group to process requests distributed by the ALB or NLB instance to which the associated server group belongs. You can specify multiple ALB or NLB server groups, but the server groups must belong to the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the scaling group. For more information, see [AttachAlbServerGroups](~~266800~~) or [AttachServerGroups](~~600535~~).\n\nIf you associated an ApsaraDB RDS instance with a scaling group, Auto Scaling automatically adds the private IP addresses of the ECS instances that are in the scaling group to the IP address whitelist of the ApsaraDB RDS instance. The ApsaraDB RDS instance that you want to associate with your scaling group must meet the following requirements:\n\n*   The ApsaraDB RDS instance must be in the **Running **state. You can call the [DescribeDBInstances](~~26232~~) operation to query the status of the ApsaraDB RDS instance.\n*   The number of IP addresses in the IP address whitelist of the ApsaraDB RDS instance cannot exceed the upper limit. For more information, see the [Configure IP address whitelists](~~43185~~) topic.\n\nIf you set the `MultiAZPolicy` parameter of the scaling group to `COST_OPTIMIZED`, take note of the following items:\n\n*   You can use the **OnDemandBaseCapacity**, **OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity**, and **SpotInstancePools **parameters to specify an instance allocation method based on the cost optimization policy. The specified instance allocation method is prioritized during scaling.\n*   If you do not specify the **OnDemandBaseCapacity**, **OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity**, or **SpotInstancePools **parameter, the instance types that are provided at the lowest price are used to create instances based on the cost optimization policy.\n\nIf you set the `Tag.N.Propagate` parameter of the scaling group to `true`, take note of the following items:\n\n*   Tags that you add to the scaling group cannot be propagated to existing instances in the scaling group. Tags that you add to the scaling group are propagated to only new instances.\n*   If you specify instance tags in the scaling configuration that is used to create instances and propagate the tags that you add to the scaling group to the instances, all tags exist at the same time.\n*   If the tag key that you specify in a scaling configuration and the tag key that you add to the scaling group of the scaling configuration are the same, the tag value that you specify in the scaling configuration is preferentially used.\n","requestParamsDescription":" ","responseParamsDescription":" "},"DeleteScalingGroup":{"methods":["post","get"],"schemes":["http","https"],"security":[{"AK":[]}],"deprecated":false,"systemTags":{"operationType":"delete"},"parameters":[{"name":"ScalingGroupId","in":"query","schema":{"description":"The ID of the scaling group.\n","type":"string","required":true,"example":"asg-bp18p2yfxow2dloq****"}},{"name":"ForceDelete","in":"query","schema":{"description":"Specifies whether to forcibly delete the scaling group and remove and release Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances in the scaling group when the ECS instances or ongoing scaling activities exist in the scaling group.

If the number of ECS instances in a scaling group is less than the minimum number allowed or greater than the maximum number allowed after a scaling rule is executed, Auto Scaling adjusts the number of ECS instances to ensure that the number of ECS instances is still within the valid range after the scaling rule is executed. Examples:\n\n*   If your scaling group contains two ECS instances and allows up to three ECS instances, only one ECS instance is added to your scaling group after you execute a scale-out rule in which three ECS instances are specified.\n*   If your scaling group contains three ECS instances and requires at least two ECS instances, only one ECS instance is removed from your scaling group after you execute a scale-in rule in which five ECS instances are specified.\n\nBefore you call this operation, take note of the following items:\n\n*   If you set **AdjustmentType** to **TotalCapacity**, the number of ECS instances in the scaling group is adjusted to a specified value. The value of **AdjustmentValue** must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\n*   If you set **AdjustmentType** to **QuantityChangeInCapacity**, a positive value of **AdjustmentValue** specifies the number of ECS instances that are added to the scaling group, and a negative value specifies the number of ECS instances that are removed from the scaling group.\n\n*   If you set **AdjustmentType** to **PercentChangeInCapacity**, Auto Scaling calculates a value by using the following formula, and then rounds the value to the nearest integer to obtain the number of ECS instances that must be scaled: Value of **TotalCapacity** × Value of **AdjustmentValue**/100.\n\n*   If you specify a cooldown period for a scaling rule, the cooldown period of the scaling rule takes effect after you execute the scaling rule. If you do not specify a cooldown period for a scaling rule, the value of **DefaultCooldown** of the scaling group takes effect after you execute the scaling rule.\n\n*   You can create only a limited number of scaling rules for a scaling group. For more information, see [Limits](~~25863~~).\n\n*   The following API operations may use the unique identifier of a scaling rule (ScalingRuleAri) that is returned by the CreateScalingRule operation:\n\n    *   ExecuteScalingRule: You can call this operation to manually execute a scaling rule. In this operation, you can set **ScalingRuleAri** to the unique identifier of the scaling rule that you want to execute.\n    *   CreateScheduledTask: You can call this operation to create a scheduled task for a scaling rule.

When the lifecycle hook takes effect, a notification can be sent by using a Message Service (MNS) topic, an MNS queue, or an Operation Orchestration Service (OOS) template. If you want to configure an OOS template, you must create a RAM role for OOS. For more information, see [Grant RAM permissions to OOS](~~120810~~).\n\n>  If your scaling group has existing ECS instances and you configured an OOS template that is used to add private IP addresses of ECS instances to or remove private IP addresses of ECS instances from IP address whitelists of cloud databases that are not ApsaraDB RDS databases, you must manually add the IP addresses to or remove the IP addresses from the IP address whitelists.\n","requestParamsDescription":" ","responseParamsDescription":" "},"DeleteLifecycleHook":{"methods":["post","get"],"schemes":["http","https"],"security":[{"AK":[]}],"systemTags":{"operationType":"delete"},"parameters":[{"name":"LifecycleHookId","in":"query","schema":{"description":"The ID of the lifecycle hook.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"ash-bp14g3ee6bt3sc98****"}},{"name":"ScalingGroupId","in":"query","schema":{"description":"The ID of the scaling group.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"asg-bp18p2yfxow2dloq****"}},{"name":"LifecycleHookName","in":"query","schema":{"description":"The name of the lifecycle hook.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"lifecyclehook****"}},{"name":"RegionId","in":"query","schema":{"description":"The ID of the region where the scaling group resides.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"cn-hangzhou"}}],"responses":{"200":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"RequestId":{"description":"The ID of the request.\n","type":"string","example":"473469C7-AA6F-4DC5-B3DB-A3DC0DE3C83E"}}}}},"responseDemo":"[{\"type\":\"json\",\"example\":\"{\\n  \\\"RequestId\\\": \\\"473469C7-AA6F-4DC5-B3DB-A3DC0DE3****\\\"\\n}\",\"errorExample\":\"\"},{\"type\":\"xml\",\"example\":\"<DeleteLifecycleHookResponse>\\n    <RequestId>473469C7-AA6F-4DC5-B3DB-A3DC0DE3****</RequestId>\\n</DeleteLifecycleHookResponse>\",\"errorExample\":\"\"}]","title":"DeleteLifecycleHook","description":"## Description\n\nIf you delete a lifecycle hook that is in effect in a scaling group, instances are removed from the pending state in advance.
