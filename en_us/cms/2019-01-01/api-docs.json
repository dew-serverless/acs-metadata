The following tags are commonly used:\n\n*   alertUnit: the unit of the metric value in alerts. If the unit is small, the original metric value may be too large. In this case, you can use the `alertUnit` tag to specify an appropriate unit. This tag is used in CloudMonitor.\n*   minAlertPeriod: the minimum time interval to report a new alert. The interval at which monitoring data is reported. The value is usually 1 minute.\n*   metricCategory: the service specification. Example: kvstore_sharding. Some Alibaba Cloud services have multiple specifications that are defined in the same namespace. This parameter is used to identify the specifications.\n*   is_alarm: indicates whether an alert rule can be configured.
