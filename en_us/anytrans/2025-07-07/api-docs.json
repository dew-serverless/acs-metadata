Grinding bricks into mirrors, piling up snow for sustenance—how many youthful years have we thus lost in delusion? Swallowing the vast ocean with a hair, fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed—why do we still wear golden crowns and forced smiles? When enlightenment dawns, we transcend the ten stages and three vehicles; yet if we linger, we remain trapped within the four realms of existence and six paths. Who has heard, beneath the shadowless tree before the cliff of utter emptiness, the cuckoo’s cry heralding spring’s dawn? The Caosi trail is perilous, and the clouds over Jiling run deep; here, old friends’ voices fade away. On cliffs of thousand-zhang ice, five-petaled lotuses bloom, and incense curls from the ancient temple’s hanging curtains. At that moment, when we discern the source and stream, we shall behold the Dragon King’s Three Treasures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis poem is titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Su Wu Slow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It tells of our Buddha, Shakyamuni, bidding farewell to the Jade Emperor and returning to the sacred abode of Leiyin. There, he found three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great vajras, and countless bodhisattvas, each holding banners, canopies, wondrous treasures, and celestial flowers, arrayed in the spiritual realm of Spirit Mountain beneath the twin banyan trees to greet him. Ascending upon auspicious clouds, Shakyamuni addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"With profound wisdom, I have manifested throughout the three realms. The fundamental nature is ultimately tranquil and extinguished, identical to the void, devoid of all things. To subdue the rebellious monkey was no easy task; few could comprehend it. Birth and death begin with names, and phenomena are as they appear.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Having spoken, he emitted rays of sarira light, filling the sky with forty-two radiant white rainbows stretching north and south. Upon seeing this, the crowd prostrated themselves in reverence. Soon after, auspicious clouds gathered, forming a lotus throne of supreme quality, upon which he sat serenely. The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight vajras, and four bodhisattvas approached, palms joined in prayer, and asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who was it that stirred up chaos in Heaven and disturbed the peach banquet?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Shakyamuni replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That fellow is a demonic monkey born on Flower Fruit Mountain, whose crimes are immeasurable and beyond description. Even the heavenly generals could not subdue him, though Erlang captured him. Even Laozi's fiery refining could not harm him. When I arrived, he was amidst the thunder gods, flaunting his might and spirit. I stopped the fighting, questioned him about his origins. He claimed supernatural powers, the ability to transform, and to ride the somersault cloud, covering one hundred and eight thousand li in a single leap. We made a wager: if he couldn't escape my grasp, I would seize him and imprison him under Five Elements Mountain. The Five Emperors opened their golden palaces and jade chambers, inviting me to take the chief seat and holding a grand assembly to honor me, after which I departed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe crowd rejoiced upon hearing this, praising him profusely. After expressing gratitude, they dispersed into their respective groups, each resuming their duties and enjoying pure bliss. Indeed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAuspicious mists fill the land of India, rainbow light surrounds the honored one. In the West, he is called first—the formless Dharma King! Often we see mystical monkeys offering fruit, deer carrying flowers; green phoenixes dance, colorful phoenixes sing; sacred turtles present longevity, cranes capture medicinal herbs. Enjoying the Pure Land of Jetavana, partaking in the dragon palace's realm of Dharma. Flowers bloom daily, fruits ripen at every hour, cultivating tranquility and returning to truth, practicing Zen with genuine results. Neither annihilation nor birth, neither increase nor decrease. Mist and rosy clouds drift freely back and forth, unaffected by cold or heat, time itself forgotten.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the poem says:\\\\\\\\nFree to come and go, carefree and at ease, free from fear and sorrow. In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, all is open and clear; in the great thousandfold world, there is neither spring nor autumn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, while residing between the sacred mountain of Leiyin and the moonlit Spirit Mountain, the Buddha summoned all the Buddhas, Arhats, protectors, bodhisattvas, vajras, monks, nuns, and others, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since subduing the rebellious monkey and pacifying Heaven, I have remained unaware of the passage of time, yet I estimate half a millennium has passed in the mortal realm, and now it is the full-moon day of early autumn. I possess a precious basin filled with a hundred varieties of flowers and a thousand kinds of exotic fruits, among other treasures. How shall we celebrate this 'Ullambana Festival' together with the Dharma?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Each member of the assembly joined their palms, bowed three times before the Buddha, and understood his intention. Then, Shakyamuni instructed Ananda to carry the basin of flowers and fruits, while Ksitigarbha scattered offerings, filling the crowd with gratitude. Everyone offered poems in thanks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of blessings says:\\\\\\\\nBlessings shine brightly before the revered one, blessings embrace the depths and extend far and wide. Boundless virtue endures as long as the earth, blessed connections link us to heaven. Fields of blessing expand yearly, the sea of fortune grows deeper with each passing year. Blessings fill the universe, abundant shade and endless growth, ever complete and boundless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of prosperity says:\\\\\\\\nProsperity weighs as heavily as mountains, the colorful phoenix sings its song. Prosperity brings timely good fortune, like the evening star shining brightly. Adding ten thousand measures of wealth ensures health and well-being, enjoying a thousand vessels of peace. Salaries rival heaven, eternally secure, names as vast as the sea, ever clearer. Thoughts of prosperity inspire admiration, titles of honor spread glory across myriad nations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The longevity poem says:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The star of longevity presents colorful offerings to the Buddha. From here, the realm of longevity shines with splendor. Plates brimming with fruits of longevity emit auspicious radiance, and freshly picked flowers of longevity adorn the lotus pedestal. The poems of longevity are elegant and full of wonders, while the melodies of longevity harmonize beautifully with talented voices. Longevity extends as long as the sun and moon, and may it be as vast and serene as mountains and seas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\After all the Bodhisattvas finished their offerings, they respectfully requested the Buddha to clearly explain the fundamental principles and trace the origins. The Buddha slightly opened his compassionate mouth, expounded the great Dharma, and proclaimed the true fruit, lecturing on the profound scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the perfection of the Five Skandhas. At that moment, heavenly dragons circled around, and flowers rained down in profusion. Indeed: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Zen mind brightly illuminates the moon over a thousand rivers, and true nature embraces the vastness of ten thousand miles of sky.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After finishing his lecture, the Buddha addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the four great continents I now manifest, sentient beings differ in goodness and evil from place to place. In the Eastern Continent of Jambudvipa, people revere heaven and earth, with clear minds and calm spirits. In the Northern Continent of Uttarakuru, though fond of their own kin, they merely struggle for survival, possessing simple natures and limited aspirations, rarely indulging in excess. In the Western Continent of Aparagodaniya, people neither covet nor kill, nurturing their qi and cultivating inner spirit; though lacking supreme truth, everyone enjoys a long life. But in the Southern Continent of Kalirupa, greed, lust, and delight in misfortune prevail, with much killing and strife—truly a battlefield of tongues and a sea of slander and evil. Now I have the Tripitaka scriptures, which can persuade people to do good.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Upon hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas clasped their hands in reverence and approached the Buddha, asking: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are the three collections of the Tripitaka scriptures?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have one collection of Dharma, discussing heaven; one collection of Vinaya, speaking of earth; and one collection of Sutra, guiding ghosts. Together, these three collections comprise thirty-five volumes, totaling 15,144 scrolls, representing the path to cultivation and the gateway to righteousness. I intend to send them to the Eastern Land, but alas, the beings there are foolish, slandering the true words and failing to understand the essence of my teachings, neglecting the authentic Yoga tradition. How can we find someone powerful enough to journey to the Eastern Land, seek out a sincere believer, guide him through hardships across thousands of mountains and distant waters, bring him to me to obtain the true scriptures, and perpetually spread them in the Eastern Land? This would indeed be a blessing as vast as mountains and a fortune as deep as the sea. Who would be willing to undertake such a journey?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At this point, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva stepped forward to the lotus pedestal, bowed three times before the Buddha, and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your disciple, though unworthy, is willing to go to the Eastern Land and find someone to retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" All present looked up at the Bodhisattva:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Perfect in virtue and wisdom, his golden body is filled with intelligence. Beaded garlands hang gracefully, fragrant rings gleam with precious light, dark clouds cleverly form coiled dragons, and embroidered ribbons gently flutter like colorful phoenix feathers. A jade clasp adorns his plain silk robe, surrounded by auspicious radiance; a brocade skirt and golden cords bring forth auspicious energy. His brows resemble crescent moons, his eyes like twin stars. Five faces naturally express joy, and his vermilion lips are touched with a hint of red. The vase of pure nectar overflows year after year, and the willow branch inserted askew remains ever green. He resolves eight difficulties and saves countless beings with great compassion; thus he dwells atop great mountains, resides in the South Sea, rescues those in suffering by responding to their cries, universally praised and answered, revered by thousands of saints and spirits. His heart delights in purple bamboo, and his nature cherishes fragrant vines. He is the compassionate lord of Mount Luojia, the living Avalokiteshvara in the Cave of Tidal Sounds.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Seeing this, the Buddha was overjoyed and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No one else can go; only the venerable Avalokiteshvara, with his vast supernatural powers, is capable of undertaking this mission.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If I go to the Eastern Land, do you have any instructions for me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On this journey, you must carefully examine the roads, not traveling through the heavens, but rather among clouds and mists. As you pass mountains and rivers, remember the distances and details of the route, and give careful guidance to the scripture seeker. Fearing that the sincere believer may find the journey difficult, I shall provide you with five treasures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Then he ordered Ananda and Kashyapa to bring forth a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"brocade kasaya robe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nine-ringed staff,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" handing them to the Bodhisattva and saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This robe and staff can be personally used by the scripture seeker. If he comes here with firm resolve, wearing my robe will prevent him from falling into reincarnation, and holding my staff will protect him from harm.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The Bodhisattva received these items with reverence, and the Buddha then took three headbands and handed them to the Bodhisattva, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These treasures are called 'tightening bands.' Though there are three identical ones, each is used differently. I have three incantations of 'Golden Tightening Seal.' If on the road you encounter powerful demons, you must persuade them to reform and become disciples of the scripture seeker. If they refuse to obey, you may place this band on their head, and it will naturally take root in their flesh. By reciting the appropriate incantation, their eyes will swell, their head will ache, and their foreheads will split open, forcing them to enter my fold.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing these words, the Bodhisattva joyfully bowed and stepped back, immediately summoning Huai'an the Pilgrim to accompany him. Huai'an wielded a solid iron staff weighing a thousand jin, serving as a mighty demon-slaying warrior at the Bodhisattva's side. The Bodhisattva then wrapped the Mirror Lake Robe into a bundle and instructed Huai'an to carry it on his back. Concealing the golden ring, the Bodhisattva took up his copper clapper and set off directly down from Spirit Mountain. This journey would bring about a significant outcome: the Buddha's disciple would return to fulfill his original vow, and Elder Golden Cicada would wrap himself in sandalwood robes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain, he was greeted by the Great Immortal of the Golden Summit at Yuzhen Temple, who stood at the temple gate to offer tea. The Bodhisattva dared not linger long and said to the Great Immortal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have received the Buddha's command to travel eastward to seek out the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Great Immortal asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"When will this pilgrim arrive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is uncertain—perhaps within two or three years, or possibly sooner.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" With that, he bade farewell to the Great Immortal, traveling through clouds and mist, carefully noting the route along the way. A poem bears witness to this journey:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Seeking across ten thousand miles without a word,\\\\\\\\nWho can claim complete success when desire remains unfulfilled?\\\\\\\\nTo seek others seems so effortless—\\\\\\\\nIs this not fate, destined for me all my life?\\\\\\\\nThe Way is taught with methods, yet without faith, even truth becomes empty rumor.\\\\\\\\nI pledge my heart and soul to find companionship;\\\\\\\\nI know surely ahead lies an encounter meant by destiny.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs master and disciple continued their journey, they suddenly came upon the Weak Water River, a vast expanse marking the boundary of the Quicksand River. The Bodhisattva remarked:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My disciple, this place proves truly difficult to traverse. How could a mortal with impure flesh and blood possibly cross over?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Huai'an asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Master, how far does this river stretch?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As the Bodhisattva paused to gaze, he saw:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To the east it connects with sandy deserts, reaching both eastern and western lands; to the south it extends to Ugo, and to the north it leads to the Tartars. Eight hundred li lie along its length, while its breadth stretches for countless miles. The water flows like the earth turning over, and the waves surge like mountains rising on their backs. Vast and boundless, desolate and endless, its roar echoes for ten li, and its floodwaters rise ten thousand feet high. Even celestial rafts cannot reach here, nor can lotus leaves float upon its surface. Withered grasses bend beneath the slanting sun, yellow clouds obscure the long embankments. Who among merchants dares to travel here? Where do fishermen find shelter? On the flat sands no geese alight, and from distant shores come the cries of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know the beauty of this scene, and the delicate fragrance of white duckweed lingers faintly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the Bodhisattva surveyed the area, a loud splash erupted from the river, and a hideous demon leaped forth from the waters. Its appearance was truly monstrous:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIts skin neither green nor black, but dull and gloomy; its body neither tall nor short, barefoot and sinewy. Its eyes gleamed like twin lamps at the hearth, its mouth forked like a butcher's cleaver. Fangs protruded like blades, and fiery hair stood disheveled. It roared like thunder, and its feet moved swiftly as if driven by a rolling wind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster brandished a magical staff and rushed ashore, attempting to seize the Bodhisattva. But Huai'an blocked him with his solid iron club, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Halt!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster raised his staff in response, and the two clashed by the Quicksand River. This fierce battle was truly astonishing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMu Zha's iron club protected the righteous path, displaying divine power; the monster's demon-slaying staff fought valiantly. Two silver serpents danced along the riverbank, and two divine beings charged toward the shore. One wielded might over the Quicksand, demonstrating extraordinary skill; the other defended Guanyin, earning great merit. One leapt and splashed through the waves, while the other spewed mist and clouds. Waves and surges darkened the heavens, mist and clouds dimmed the sun and moon. That demon-slaying staff resembled a white tiger emerging from the mountains; this solid iron club was like a yellow dragon lying in wait. One advanced, parting snakes and stirring grass; the other swung wide, scattering hawks and splitting pines. The battle raged until darkness enveloped everything, stars shone brightly, and mist swirled, blurring heaven and earth. That one had long dwelled in the Weak Water, fierce and relentless; this one achieved his first great feat since leaving Spirit Mountain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two fought back and forth for dozens of rounds, evenly matched, with no clear victor. Finally, the monster blocked Mu Zha's iron club and demanded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, to dare confront me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am Mu Zha, the Second Prince of the Heavenly King Tota, known as Huai'an the Pilgrim. I now accompany my master on a journey to the Eastern Lands to seek the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures. Who are you, demon, to boldly block our path?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster suddenly realized, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I remember you practicing alongside Guanyin of the South Sea in the Bamboo Grove! Why have you come here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that Master standing on the shore?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHearing this, the monster stammered repeatedly, lowered his magical staff, and allowed Mu Zha to lead him before Guanyin. Prostrating himself, he pleaded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and listen to my confession. I am no evil spirit—I am the Scroll-Raising General, an attendant to the imperial carriage in the Celestial Palace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I accidentally broke a glass cup during the cricket peach banquet that the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes and banished me to the mortal realm, transforming me into this wretched form. Moreover, every seven days, he commands flying swords to pierce my chest and sides more than a hundred times before withdrawing. Thus, I suffer such torment. With no other choice, driven by unbearable hunger and cold, every two or three days I venture out into the waves to seek passersby for sustenance. Little did I expect today, through ignorance, to have offended the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You were guilty in Heaven, and now that you've been cast down, you continue to harm living beings—truly, sin upon sin. I have received Buddha's decree to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. Why don't you join my path, embrace virtuous fruit, become a disciple of that pilgrim, and accompany him westward to pay homage to the Buddha and obtain the sacred texts? Then I shall ensure the flying swords no longer pierce you. Once your mission is accomplished, you'll be absolved of guilt and restored to your original position. What say you?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am willing to embrace the righteous path.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Stepping forward, he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless humans here, and several pilgrims have passed by, all of whom I've consumed. Every time I ate someone, I tossed their head into the quicksand, where it sank straight to the bottom (a water so deep even goose feathers cannot float). Yet nine pilgrims' skulls floated on the surface, refusing to sink. Thinking them strange objects, I strung them together with a rope and kept them for amusement during idle moments. But now, if the pilgrims never reach this place, wouldn't that only hinder my own future prospects?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How could they possibly fail to arrive? You may hang those skulls above your head as a reminder, waiting patiently for the pilgrims; they will surely prove useful.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If that's the case, I gladly accept your guidance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred the precepts upon him, designated sand as his surname, and thus he became known as Sha Wujing. From that moment, he entered the monastic order, helped the Bodhisattva cross the river, purified his heart and mind, resolved never again to harm living beings, and dedicated himself solely to awaiting the pilgrim.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter bidding farewell to the monster, the Bodhisattva and Muzha set off directly toward the Eastern lands. After traveling for some time, they came upon another towering mountain shrouded in malevolent energy, making it impossible to climb. Just as they prepared to ride the clouds over the mountain, a sudden gust of wind arose, and another demon appeared. This demon was truly fearsome:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHis lips curled upward like lotus petals, his ears resembled giant fans, and his golden eyes gleamed fiercely. His tusks were sharp as steel files, and his gaping mouth seemed like a blazing brazier. A golden helmet tightly secured his cheeks, and armored scales adorned his body like a retreating python. In one hand, he wielded a spiked club resembling a dragon's claw, while a crescent-shaped bow hung from his waist, its ten arrows gleaming brightly. His imposing presence intimidated even the fiercest spirits, and his soaring ambition dwarfed the might of celestial gods. Without hesitation, he charged forward, aiming his spiked club at the Bodhisattva. But Muzha stepped in to block the attack, shouting loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You vile monster, how dare you behave so rudely! Take this!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The demon retorted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This monk doesn't know when to die! Here's my pitchfork!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" And so, beneath the mountain, the two clashed fiercely, battling to decide the victor. It was a truly fierce fight:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe demon was ferocious, yet Hui'an possessed great power. Iron clubs split hearts, and spiked drills met faces head-on. Dust and dirt filled the air, darkening heaven and earth, while flying rocks and debris startled ghosts and gods. The nine-pronged pitchfork gleamed brilliantly, its double rings ringing clearly; the iron staff was sleek and black, soaring through both hands. One was the prince of the Heavenly King, the other a valiant general spirit. One protected the law on Mount Putuo, the other dwelled as a demon in a cave. In this encounter, neither knew who would lose nor who would win.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the two were locked in battle, Guanyin appeared in mid-air, tossing down a lotus flower to separate the pitchfork and staff. Startled, the monster asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, daring to play tricks like 'flowers before my eyes' to deceive me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You mere mortal with fleshly eyes! I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. This lotus flower was thrown by my master—you can't even recognize it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Bodhisattva of the South Sea—is that Guanyin, who sweeps away three calamities and rescues from eight tribulations?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who else could it be?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster dropped his spiked club, bowed deeply, and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother, where is the Bodhisattva? Please trouble yourself to introduce me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuzha pointed upward and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't it right there?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster bowed repeatedly toward the sky, crying out loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive me! Forgive me!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGuanyin descended from the clouds and approached, asking, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What kind of wild boar transformed into a spirit are you, what sort of old pig wreaks havoc here, daring to block my way?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am neither a wild boar nor an old pig—I was originally Tianpeng, the Marshal of the Heavenly River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I teased Chang'e while drunk that the Jade Emperor struck me with two thousand hammer blows and banished me to the mortal realm. My true spirit, in a misguided attempt at rebirth, mistakenly entered the womb of a sow, resulting in this monstrous form. I bit and killed the sow, slaughtered the entire herd of pigs, and seized this mountain territory, surviving by preying on humans. Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered you, Bodhisattva—please, I beg you, save me! Tassa asked, “What is the name of this mountain?” The monster replied, “It’s called Mount Fuleng. Within the mountain lies a cave known as Yunzhan Cave. Originally, there lived a woman named Egg Sister Two inside that cave. Seeing that I had some martial skills, she made me the head of the household and even nicknamed me ‘Inverted Gate.’ But less than a year later, she died, leaving all her possessions to me. Now, after living here for so long, I have no meaningful occupation.” The Bodhisattva said, “As the ancients taught: ‘If you wish for a future, avoid actions that lead to none.’ You broke the laws of Heaven above, yet still refuse to abandon your violent nature, harming living beings and creating karma. Isn’t that committing two offenses at once?” The monster retorted, “A future? A future! If I followed your advice, I’d be left to starve! As the saying goes: ‘Obeying official law means being beaten to death; obeying Buddhist law means starving to death.’ Go away! Go away! It’s better to catch a traveler and feast on his fatty flesh! Who cares about two sins, three sins, a thousand sins, ten thousand sins!” The Bodhisattva replied, “‘Heaven responds to sincere human wishes.’ If you’re willing to turn to the righteous path, there will surely be a place for you to sustain yourself. The world has five grains; they can all satisfy hunger—why must you survive by eating people?” Upon hearing this, the monster seemed to awaken from a dream and said to the Bodhisattva, “I want to follow the right path, but how can I when ‘to offend Heaven leaves no prayer unanswered’?” The Bodhisattva continued, “I’ve received Buddha’s command to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. You could become his disciple and accompany him on a journey westward, redeeming your sins through merit, and I’ll ensure you escape this calamity.” The monster eagerly agreed, exclaiming, “I’m willing! I’m willing!” The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred upon him the precepts, assigned him the surname Zhu (Pig), gave him the Dharma name Zhu Wuneng, and instructed him to observe vegetarian vows, renouncing the five pungent vegetables and the three forbidden meats, patiently awaiting the arrival of the pilgrim. After parting ways with Mutza, the Bodhisattva and Mutza rose into the clouds, traveling onward, when suddenly they saw a jade dragon crying out in mid-air. Approaching it, the Bodhisattva asked, “Who are you, dragon, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon replied, “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I set fire to the luminous pearl in the palace, my father reported me to Heaven, accusing me of rebellion. The Five Emperors hung me in mid-air and beat me three hundred times, and soon I’ll be executed. Please, Bodhisattva, save me!” Hearing this, Guanyin immediately rushed with Mutza toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. There, the two celestial masters, Qiu and Zhang, greeted them and asked, “Where are you headed?” The Bodhisattva replied, “This humble monk wishes to see the Jade Emperor.” The two masters quickly reported the request, and the Jade Emperor descended from his throne to welcome them. After paying respects, the Bodhisattva said, “I’ve been sent by Buddha to seek the pilgrim in the Eastern Lands. On my way, I encountered a wicked dragon hanging here, and I’ve come specifically to petition for mercy, asking that his life be spared and entrusted to me, so he may serve as a mount for the pilgrim.” Upon hearing this, the Five Emperors immediately issued an edict of pardon, ordering a heavenly general to release the dragon and deliver him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva expressed gratitude and departed. The little dragon prostrated himself, thanking the Bodhisattva for saving his life, and pledged obedience to her commands. The Bodhisattva placed him deep in a ravine, where he would wait for the pilgrim to arrive, transforming into a white horse and earning merit in the West. The little dragon accepted the order and quietly disappeared. Leading Mutza, the Bodhisattva continued her journey across this mountain and onward toward the Eastern Lands. Not long after, they suddenly saw countless golden rays of light and auspicious vapors rising in thousands of streams. Mutza exclaimed, “Master, that shining place must be the Five Elements Mountain, where the Buddha’s ‘seal’ is affixed!” The Bodhisattva confirmed, “Indeed, that’s the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who once disrupted the Peach Banquet and caused chaos in the Heavenly Palace—he now lies imprisoned beneath this seal.” Mutza agreed, “Exactly, exactly!” Master and disciple climbed the mountain together and gazed upon the inscription, which read the six-syllable mantra: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” After examining it, the Bodhisattva sighed deeply and composed a poem, which reads:  \\\\\\\\nHow pitiful that the mischievous monkey defied authority,  \\\\\\\\nOnce reckless and bold, flaunting heroic might.  \\\\\\\\nDeceitful, he disrupted the Peach Banquet,  \\\\\\\\nDaringly intruded upon the Tuishou Palace.  \\\\\\\\nUnrivaled among ten thousand soldiers,  \\\\\\\\nHis might resounded through the nine heavens.  \\\\\\\\nNow trapped by our Buddha Shakyamuni,  \\\\\\\\nWhen will he stretch forth again and display his glory?  \\\\\\\\nWhile master and disciple were speaking, the Great Sage was already alerted.Da Sheng stood at the foot of the mountain and shouted loudly,  \\\\\\\\n“Who is it up there on the hill, reciting poetry and exposing my flaws?”  \\\\\\\\nUpon hearing this, the Bodhisattva immediately descended the mountain to investigate. Below the rocky cliff, they found the local deity, the mountain god, and the celestial generals who had been guarding the Great Sage—all coming forward to greet the Bodhisattva and escort them before the Great Sage himself. When they looked closely, they saw that he was trapped inside a stone casket, able to speak but unable to move. The Bodhisattva asked, “Hey you with the surname Sun, do you recognize me?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage opened his fiery golden eyes, nodded vigorously, and cried out, “How could I not know you? You are indeed the compassionate and merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo in the South Sea, who saves those in distress and hardship. Thank you for your kindness! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been spending each day here like an eternity, with not a single acquaintance to visit me. But pray tell, where have you come from?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “I was sent by the Buddha’s decree to journey eastward in search of someone to retrieve scriptures. Passing by here, I paused briefly to check on you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage said, “The Buddha deceived me, trapping me beneath this mountain for over five hundred years, unable to break free. I earnestly beg you, great Bodhisattva, to show me some mercy and rescue old Sun once and for all!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva responded, “Your sins run deep. If I were to free you now, I fear you’d only cause more trouble—such an outcome would hardly be commendable.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage insisted, “I’ve already repented deeply. Please, great compassionate one, point me toward a path of redemption, and I’ll willingly devote myself to cultivation.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so it came to pass:  \\\\\\\\n“A single thought arises in the human heart, and heaven and earth take note. If good and evil remain unpunished, surely heaven and earth must harbor bias.”  \\\\\\\\nHearing these words, the Bodhisattva felt immense joy and said to the Great Sage, “As the scriptures say: ‘Speak kindly, and distant lands will respond; speak unkindly, and distant lands will recoil.’ Since you’ve shown such sincerity, when I reach the Tang Empire in the East, I’ll find someone tasked with retrieving scriptures and instruct him to rescue you. You can become his disciple, uphold the teachings, and enter the Buddhist fold. Then we can work together toward enlightenment. What do you say?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage exclaimed loudly, “I accept! I accept!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva continued, “Since you’ve shown such virtue, let me give you a Dharma name.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage replied, “I already have a name—I’m called Sun Wukong.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva happily added, “Two others have previously taken refuge under the character ‘Wu’—you too shall bear that character, perfectly aligning with them. How wonderful, how wonderful! There’s no need for further reminders; I shall depart now.”  \\\\\\\\nThus, the Great Sage, having realized his true nature, returned wholeheartedly to Buddhism, while the Bodhisattva lingered, mindful of her divine mission.  \\\\\\\\nTogether with Mutzha, they set off eastward, arriving without delay in Chang’an, the capital of the Tang Empire. As mist cleared and clouds dispersed, master and disciple transformed into two ragged, leprous monks, entering the city of Chang’an unnoticed, unaware that evening had already fallen. Walking along the main market street, they spotted a local deity shrine and stepped right inside, startling the local deity and sending the ghostly soldiers into trembling fear. Realizing it was the Bodhisattva, the deity quickly prostrated himself in reverence. Hastily, the local deity ran to inform the City God, the district magistrate, and all the deities of every temple throughout Chang’an, who promptly gathered to pay their respects, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our tardiness in welcoming you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “You must not reveal this news. I’ve come here specifically by the Buddha’s command to seek out someone who will retrieve scriptures. I’ll temporarily stay in your temple for a few days, until I find the true monk, then I’ll return.”  \\\\\\\\nAll the deities returned to their respective posts, and the local deity was hurriedly relocated to the City God’s temple for temporary residence, while the master and disciple concealed their true forms.  \\\\\\\\nFor now, we don’t yet know whether they’ll succeed in finding the scripture seeker. Tune in next time to find out.  \\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Appendix: Chen Guangrui Sets Off for Office and Encounters Disaster; Jiangliu Monk Takes Revenge to Restore His Roots.  \\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of Chang’an, the great capital of Shaanxi Province, a city built as the imperial seat by emperors of past dynasties. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han eras, the three districts have blossomed like brocade, and eight rivers flow around the city, truly making it a land of scenic wonders. At this time, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Zhenguan, and had already reigned for thirteen years, in the year of Ji Si. The realm enjoyed peace, tribute flowed in from all directions, and the four seas acknowledged his sovereignty. One day, Emperor Taizong convened all civil and military officials, and after the morning ceremony concluded, Prime Minister Wei Zheng stepped forward and reported, “Today the realm is peaceful, and tranquility prevails in all directions. In accordance with ancient custom, we should open examination halls, recruit talented individuals, and promote capable people to serve in governance.”  \\\\\\\\nEmperor Taizong said,  \\\\\\\\n“What you propose, esteemed minister, is entirely reasonable.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so he issued a notice calling for talented scholars, proclaiming throughout the empire: all prefectures, provinces, and counties, regardless of whether they were military or civilian, anyone among the literati who possessed clear understanding of classical texts and excelled in the three examinations, should travel to Chang’an to take the test.When the imperial edict reached the region of Haizhou, a man named Chen Guangrui, with the courtesy name E, saw it and immediately returned home. He said to his mother, Lady Zhang, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The court has issued a yellow proclamation, calling for talented individuals from southern provinces to take the examinations. I intend to go and compete. If I can secure even a minor official post, it will bring honor and fame to my family, ensure prosperity for my wife and children, and bring glory to our household—this is my greatest ambition. I am informing you of my decision before I depart.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My son, as a scholar, you should indeed 'study in youth and act in adulthood.' That is exactly how it should be. But when you go to take the exams, you must be careful along the way, and once you obtain an official position, return home promptly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui then instructed his servants to pack his belongings, bid farewell to his mother, and set off on his journey without delay. Upon arriving in Chang'an, he found that the examination grounds were already open, so he entered the competition. After passing the preliminary tests and successfully completing the three policy essays in the imperial court examination, Emperor Tang personally bestowed upon him the title of zhuangyuan (top scholar) and awarded him a horse to ride through the streets for three days. Unexpectedly, during his parade, he passed by the residence of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, whose only daughter, Wen Jiao, also known as Mantang Jiao, had not yet married. She was standing atop a beautifully decorated pavilion, tossing a silk ball to select her husband. As Chen Guangrui happened to pass below, the young lady caught sight of his outstanding appearance and recognized him as the newly crowned zhuangyuan. Overjoyed, she threw down the silk ball, which landed squarely on Guangrui's black official cap. Suddenly, a gentle melody of flutes and strings filled the air, and more than ten maids descended from the pavilion, leading Guangrui's horse and escorting him into the prime minister's mansion to celebrate their wedding. The prime minister and his wife immediately came out to greet the guests, officiated the ceremony, and formally betrothed the young lady to Guangrui. They bowed to heaven and earth, exchanged vows as husband and wife, and paid respects to the bride's parents. The prime minister then ordered a banquet to be prepared, and they celebrated joyfully throughout the night.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two held hands tenderly as they entered the bridal chamber. The next morning, at the third watch of the day, Emperor Taizong took his seat in the Golden Hall, surrounded by civil and military officials who had gathered for court. Taizong asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What official position should be granted to the newly appointed zhuangyuan, Chen Guangrui?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Prime Minister Wei Zheng replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your servant has examined the available vacancies in various prefectures and counties and found that Jiangzhou currently has an unoccupied post. I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint him to this position.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Taizong immediately agreed and appointed Guangrui as governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to prepare for departure without delay. Guangrui expressed his gratitude, left the palace, returned to the prime minister's residence, discussed the matter with his wife, bid farewell to his in-laws, and set off with his wife toward Jiangzhou to assume his new post.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they left Chang'an, the weather was late spring, with gentle breezes turning the willows green and fine rain sprinkling red blossoms. Upon arriving home, Guangrui and his wife paid their respects to Lady Zhang. Lady Zhang said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Congratulations, my son! You've not only succeeded in the examinations but have also brought your bride home.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is entirely due to your blessings, Mother, that I was fortunate enough to become zhuangyuan, received the imperial procession through the streets, and encountered the silk ball toss in front of Prime Minister Yin's residence, where I was chosen as his daughter's husband. Now the court has appointed me governor of Jiangzhou, and I have come to fetch you so we may all travel together to take up my post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang was overjoyed and began preparing for the journey. After several days on the road, they arrived at Liu Xiao'er's inn near Wanhuadian. Suddenly, Lady Zhang fell ill, and she said to Guangrui, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm feeling unwell. Let's rest here for two days to recover before continuing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui obeyed her wishes. The following morning, he noticed a man selling a golden carp outside the inn. Guangrui bought it for one guan, intending to cook it for his mother. But as he looked closer, he saw that the fish blinked its eyes mysteriously. Astonished, Guangrui exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've heard that fish and snakes blink their eyes—it surely can't be an ordinary creature!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He then asked the fisherman, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Where did you catch this fish?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Fifteen li from the city, in the Hongjiang River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui immediately released the fish back into the river. Returning to the inn, he told his mother about it, and she said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Releasing living creatures is a virtuous deed, and I'm very pleased.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui added, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We've already stayed here for three days, and time is pressing. I plan to leave tomorrow, but I wonder if you're well enough to travel?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not feeling well, and the heat along the road might worsen my condition. Why don't you rent a house here temporarily while I stay behind? Leave some money with me, and you two can go ahead to take up your post. I'll join you when the autumn coolness arrives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui consulted with his wife, rented a house, gave his mother some funds, and bid them both farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe journey was arduous, with days of travel and nights spent in lodging, and soon they reached the Hongjiang ferry crossing. There, they found Liu Hong and Li Biao waiting to guide them across the river. It seemed that Guangrui's past karma had destined him to encounter these ill-fated individuals.Guangrui ordered his servant to carry their luggage aboard the boat. As husband and wife were about to board together, Liu Hong opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin: her face was as bright as the full moon, her eyes like autumn waters, her lips cherry-red, and her waist slender as a willow branch—indeed possessing beauty enough to make fish sink and wild geese fall from the sky, a countenance so dazzling it could shame the moon and blush flowers. Instantly consumed by wolfish intent, he conspired with Li Biao, steering the boat to an uninhabited stretch of water. When midnight struck, they first killed the servant, then beat Guangrui to death, dumping both bodies into the river. Seeing her husband slain, the young lady prepared to throw herself into the water as well. But Liu Hong grabbed her tightly, saying, “If you yield to me, all will be forgiven! If not, I’ll cut you down right here!” With no other choice, the lady reluctantly agreed, submitting to Liu Hong for the time being. The villain then rowed the boat to the southern shore, handing it over to Li Biao to manage, while he himself donned Guangrui’s attire and official credentials, taking the lady with him to assume his post in Jiangzhou.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the body of the murdered servant drifted downstream with the current, but Guangrui’s corpse sank to the bottom and remained motionless. A sea demon patrolling near the mouth of the Hong River happened to notice it and immediately reported to the Dragon King’s palace. At that very moment, the Dragon King was presiding over court when the demon reported: “Today, near the mouth of the Hong River, someone unknown has beaten to death a scholar and left his body at the bottom of the water.” The Dragon King ordered the body to be brought forth and examined closely. Upon inspection, he declared, “This man is none other than my savior! How could he have been murdered? As the saying goes, one repays kindness with kindness. Today, I must save his life to repay the favor he once showed me.” He immediately penned an official decree and dispatched the demon straight to the City God and Land Deity of Hongzhou, instructing them to retrieve the scholar’s soul and restore his life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe City God and Land Deity summoned a little ghost to deliver Chen Guangrui’s soul to the demon, who carried it to the Crystal Palace and presented it to the Dragon King. The Dragon King asked, “Young scholar, what is your name and family name? Where are you from? Why did you come here, only to be murdered?” Guangrui bowed respectfully and replied, “I am Chen E, courtesy name Guangrui, from Hongnong County, Haizhou. I was fortunate enough to become the top scholar in the recent imperial examinations and appointed governor of Jiangzhou. On my way to take up my post with my wife, we boarded a boat by the riverbank, only to be betrayed by the villain Liu Hong, who coveted my wife and murdered me, casting my body into the water. Great King, please save me!” Hearing this, the Dragon King said, “So it is! Sir, the golden carp you released earlier was none other than myself. You saved my life, and now that you’re in trouble, how could I possibly refuse to help?” He then had Guangrui’s body placed aside, inserting a magical bead into his mouth to preserve it intact, so that one day it could regain its spirit and seek vengeance. He added, “For now, your true soul shall temporarily serve as a chief official in my underwater realm.” Guangrui bowed deeply in gratitude, and the Dragon King hosted a banquet in his honor, which need not be detailed further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin loathed Liu the villain with every fiber of her being, wishing she could devour his flesh and flay his skin—but pregnant as she was, unsure whether the child was a boy or girl, she had no choice but to endure and comply for the time being. Before she knew it, they had arrived in Jiangzhou. Officials, clerks, and servants all came out to greet them. Local dignitaries arranged a grand banquet in the courthouse to celebrate. Liu Hong said, “My arrival here today is entirely due to your generous support.” The officials replied, “Your Excellency is highly talented and virtuous; naturally, you treat the people as your own children, keeping lawsuits simple and punishments light. We, your subordinates, are fortunate indeed—why be so modest?” After the banquet concluded, everyone dispersed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTime passed swiftly. One day, Liu Hong had urgent business far away, leaving the lady alone in the official residence, longing for her mother-in-law and husband. Sitting in the flower pavilion, she sighed deeply, suddenly feeling weary, with pain in her abdomen, and fainting to the ground. Unbeknownst to her, she gave birth to a son. Suddenly, a voice whispered in her ear: “Beloved daughter-in-law, heed my words carefully. I am the Star Lord of the South Pole, sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva’s command specifically to entrust this child to you. In the future, he will achieve great fame and distinction, far beyond the ordinary. When Liu the villain returns, he will surely harm this child, so you must protect him diligently. Your husband has already been rescued by the Dragon King; someday, husband and wife will reunite, mother and son will be reunited, and justice will finally be served. Remember my words well—wake up, wake up!” Having spoken these words, the voice vanished. The lady awoke, recalling every word clearly, clutching her child tightly, yet feeling utterly helpless. Suddenly, Liu Hong returned and, upon seeing the child, immediately tried to drown him. The lady quickly said, “It’s already late today; let’s wait until tomorrow to throw him into the river.” Fortunately, early the next morning, Liu Hong received urgent orders to leave on another distant errand. Secretly, the lady thought, “If we wait until the villain returns, this child’s life will be lost! Better to abandon him in the river now and let fate decide his destiny.”\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If Heaven takes pity on us and someone rescues this child, raising him as their own, perhaps we shall meet again someday.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But fearing it might be difficult to recognize him later, she bit her finger until it bled, writing a blood letter detailing her parents' names, origins, and the full story of their plight. She then bit off the little toe from the child's left foot, using it as a distinctive mark. Taking a close-fitting undershirt, she wrapped the baby in it and, seizing an opportune moment, carried him out of the official residence. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, so the young lady hurried to the riverside and burst into tears. Just as she was about to abandon the child, she suddenly noticed a wooden plank drifting lazily along the riverbank. Bowing toward the heavens in prayer, she carefully placed the baby onto the plank, secured him with a strap, tied the blood letter to his chest, and gently pushed the makeshift raft into the river, letting fate guide its course. With tears streaming down her face, she returned to the residence without further ado.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the child floated downstream on the wooden plank, drifting steadily until he came to rest at the foot of Jinshan Temple. The abbot of Jinshan Temple was a venerable monk named Faming, who had attained profound enlightenment through spiritual cultivation and mastered the subtle secrets of immortality. While meditating in deep contemplation, he suddenly heard the cries of a baby. His heart stirred, and he hurried to the riverside, where he saw a tiny infant sleeping peacefully on a piece of driftwood. Hastily, he rescued the child and, upon examining the blood letter clutched in the baby's hand, learned of his origins. He gave the child a nickname, Jiangliu, entrusted him to others for care, and carefully preserved the blood letter as a precious keepsake. Time flew by like an arrow, days and months passing swiftly, and before anyone realized it, Jiangliu had grown into an eighteen-year-old youth. The abbot then called him forward, shaved his head, and ordained him as a monk, giving him the Dharma name Xuanzang. After receiving the precepts and having his head touched, Xuanzang resolved firmly to pursue the path of enlightenment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, during the late spring season, everyone gathered beneath the shade of pine trees to listen to sutras, engage in meditation, and discuss profound teachings. At that very moment, a dissolute monk who indulged in meat and wine found himself utterly confounded by Xuanzang. Enraged, the monk lashed out, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You wretched creature! You don't even know your own name or your parents—what right do you have to meddle here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Hearing such harsh words, Xuanzang knelt before his master in the temple, tears streaming down his face, and pleaded earnestly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"All beings are born between heaven and earth, nourished by yin and yang and sustained by the five elements. It is only natural that one is born of a father and raised by a mother. How can there be a person in this world without parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He continued to implore his master repeatedly, begging to learn the names of his parents. The abbot finally said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you truly wish to find your parents, come with me to my quarters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang followed him to the abbot's chamber, where the elder climbed up to the rafters, retrieved a small box, and opened it to reveal the blood letter and the undershirt, handing them over to Xuanzang. As Xuanzang unfolded the blood letter and read it carefully, he finally learned the full details of his parents' names and the tragic circumstances surrounding their wrongful deaths. Upon finishing the reading, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How can I call myself human if I cannot avenge my parents' wrongs? For eighteen years, I've lived without knowing my birth parents, and only today do I discover that I have a mother. Had it not been for my master rescuing and nurturing me, how could I stand here today? Please allow me to go seek out my mother, and afterward, I will carry incense bowls on my head, rebuild the temple, and repay my master's immense kindness!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you wish to find your mother, take this blood letter and undershirt with you. Simply beg alms as you travel directly to the private residence in Jiangzhou, and there you shall surely meet your mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang accepted his master's instructions, disguised himself as a mendicant monk, and set off straight for Jiangzhou. Coincidentally, Liu Hong happened to be away on business, and fate seemed to bring mother and son together. Xuanzang arrived at the gate of the private residence, chanting sutras and calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Yin, meanwhile, had dreamt the previous night of a waning moon that had fully regained its roundness. She mused to herself, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother-in-law remains missing, my husband was murdered by bandits, and my son was cast into the river. If someone has adopted him, he must now be eighteen years old. Perhaps today, heaven has arranged for us to meet again—it cannot be mere coincidence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As she pondered these thoughts, she suddenly heard someone chanting sutras outside the residence, calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Seizing the opportunity, she stepped out and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"From where do you come?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am a humble monk, a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"So you are indeed a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple—\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and invited him inside, offering him a meal. As she observed his demeanor and speech closely, she noticed a striking resemblance to her late husband. She dismissed her maidservants and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Young master, did you become a monk from childhood, or did you enter the monastic life later in life? What is your full name, and do you still have living parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I did not become a monk in childhood, nor did I enter the priesthood in middle age. To tell you the truth, my grievances are as vast as the sky, and my hatred runs as deep as the sea! My father was treacherously murdered, and my mother was taken by bandits. My master, Abbot Faming, instructed me to come to the Jiangzhou residence and search for my mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is your mother's surname?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother's surname is Yin, her given name is Wenjiao; my father's surname is Chen, his given name is Guangrui; my childhood nickname was Jiangliu, and my Dharma name is Xuanzang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wenjiao—that is me! But what proof do you have to support your claim?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing that it was his mother, Xuanzang dropped to his knees and burst into tears: “If my mother doesn’t believe me, here’s proof—a blood-written undershirt!” Wenjiao took the undershirt and examined it carefully; sure enough, it was genuine. Mother and son embraced each other, weeping bitterly, and she urged him, “My son, hurry and leave at once!” Xuanzang replied, “For eighteen years I’ve never known my birth parents, and only today have I finally met my mother—how can I bear to part from her?” The young lady said, “My son, you must quickly make your escape! If Liu the bandit returns, he’ll surely take your life! Tomorrow I’ll pretend to fall ill, claiming that years ago I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk’s shoes, and I’ll come to your temple to fulfill that vow. At that time, I’ll have something important to tell you.” Xuanzang, following her advice, bowed farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, ever since seeing her son, the young lady had been filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry. One day, she suddenly feigned illness, refusing food and drink, and lay down in bed. When Liu Hong returned to the office and asked about the reason, she said, “When I was young, I made a vow to donate one hundred pairs of monk’s shoes. Five days ago, I dreamt of a monk holding a sharp blade, demanding those shoes, and ever since then I’ve felt unwell.” Liu Hong exclaimed, “Why didn’t you mention such a trivial matter earlier?” He immediately ordered Wang Zuo Ya and Li You Ya to convene in court: all households in Jiangzhou city were instructed to prepare one pair of monk’s shoes each, with a deadline of five days for completion. The people dutifully fulfilled the order. Then the young lady turned to Liu Hong and asked, “Now that the monk’s shoes are ready, which temple would be suitable for me to go and fulfill my vow?” Liu Hong replied, “In Jiangzhou there’s Jinshan Temple and Jiaoshan Temple—whichever temple you prefer, you may choose.” The young lady said, “I’ve long heard that Jinshan Temple is an excellent monastery, so I shall go there.” Liu Hong immediately summoned Wang and Li, ordering them to prepare a boat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady brought along her trusted attendants, boarded the boat, and as soon as the oars pushed off, they headed straight for Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, back at the temple, Xuanzang reported everything to Elder Faming, who was overjoyed upon hearing the tale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, a maid arrived first, announcing that the lady had come to the temple to fulfill her vow. All the monks came out to greet her.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady walked directly through the temple gates, paid homage to the Bodhisattva, and arranged a grand vegetarian feast. She then instructed her maids to place the monk’s shoes and socks on a tray. When she reached the main hall, she again lit incense and offered prayers, after which she asked Elder Faming to distribute the offerings among the monks. Once the monks had dispersed and the hall was empty, Xuanzang knelt forward. The young lady asked him to remove his shoes and socks, and indeed, a small toe was missing from his left foot. At that moment, the two embraced once more, weeping uncontrollably, and expressed their gratitude to the elder for raising him. Faming said, “Now that mother and son have reunited, there’s a risk that the villain might find out. You must quickly withdraw before disaster strikes.” The young lady added, “My son, I’m giving you this ring as a token. Head northwest toward Hongzhou, a journey of roughly fifteen hundred li. There, in Wanhuadian, you’ll find Granny Zhang, your father’s own mother. I’ve also written you a letter to deliver to the imperial palace in Tang’s capital, to the home of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, on the left side of the Golden Hall—those are your maternal grandparents. Hand my letter to your grandfather, and ask him to petition the Tang emperor, gather troops, capture this villain, avenge your father, and only then will your mother’s life be saved. I dare not linger here any longer, for fear that the villain might suspect me if I return late.” With that, she left the temple, boarded the boat, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang returned to the temple, weeping, and informed his master before bidding farewell immediately, heading straight for Hongzhou. Upon arriving at Wanhuadian, he asked the shopkeeper, Liu Xia’er, “Years ago, a guest named Chen from Jiangzhou stayed at your inn with his mother. How is she doing now?” Liu Xia’er replied, “She did stay at my inn, but later her eyesight failed, and for three or four years she didn’t pay me rent. Now she lives in a dilapidated kiln near the South Gate, begging daily on the streets to survive. That guest left long ago, and since then we’ve had no news of him whatsoever—no one knows why.” Upon hearing this, Xuanzang immediately went to the South Gate and found the old woman living in the broken kiln. The old woman exclaimed, “Your voice sounds just like my son, Chen Guangrui!” Xuanzang replied, “I’m not Chen Guangrui—I’m his son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother.” The old woman asked, “Why haven’t your parents come?” Xuanzang answered, “My father was beaten to death by bandits, and my mother was taken by force as their wife.” The old woman continued, “How did you know to come looking for me?” Xuanzang explained, “My mother sent me to find you. She gave me a letter and a ring.” The old woman took the letter and the ring, bursting into tears as she cried out, “My son came all this way for fame and success—I thought he’d betrayed us and forgotten his kindness, never imagining he’d been murdered!”And I am glad that the emperor has pity on me. After my son, today there are grandchildren looking for me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are your mother-in-law's eyes faint?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I cried so hard that my eyes fainted because I thought about your father all day long and I didn't see him coming.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the Sky: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and his parents' hatred cannot be avenged. Today, I took my mother's order to find my mother-in-law. If the sky shows my disciple's sincerity, I will keep my mother-in-law's eyes clear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After wishing, he licked the tip of his tongue and his mother-in-law's eyes. In a moment, my eyes lick open and still return to the same place. The mother-in-law looked at the young monk and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You are my grandson! It's just like my son Guang Rui!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law was happy and sad. Xuanzang took her mother-in-law out of the kiln door, went to Liu Xiaoer's shop, and put some money in a house to live with her mother-in-law. Then she entangled herself with her mother-in-law and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'll be back in less than a month.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Then he quit his mother-in-law and headed for the capital. He found Prime Minister Yin's Mansion on Huangcheng East Street and said to the door, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The little monk is a relative. Come to visit Xianggong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The door was informed of the prime minister, who said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have no relatives with the monk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The wife said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I dreamed last night that my daughter came home full of charming, unless my son-in-law came back with letters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister then taught the young monk to come to the hall. When the young monk saw the Prime Minister and his wife, he cried and bowed to the ground. He took out a book from his arms and handed it to the prime minister. The Prime Minister opened it, read it from the beginning, and cried bitterly. The lady asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What was the accident?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This Monk is my nephew and yours. Son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by thieves, and Mantang Jiao was forcibly taken as his wife by thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Madame listened and cried bitterly. The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Madam is worried. Come to the court to tell the Lord and personally command the troops. You must avenge your son-in-law.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The next day, the prime minister entered the dynasty and inspired the Tang King to say: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Today, Chen Guangrui, the top scholar of his son-in-law, led his family Xiaojiang to take office. He was killed by Liu Hong, a little water, and took his daughter as his wife. He pretended to be a son-in-law and became an official for many years. This is a change. His Majesty beggars immediately sent troops to eliminate thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" When the King of the Tang Dynasty saw that he was furious, he sent 60,000 Imperial troops to the Prime Minister Yin to supervise the soldiers. The Prime Minister led the decree out of the court, that is, he ordered soldiers to the teaching ground and headed for Jiangzhou. Xiao Xing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, but he did not realize he had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's soldiers and horses all went down to camp on the north bank. Starry night ordered the gold medal to be called to Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state sentenced two people. The Prime Minister told him that he knew about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before the sky was clear, Liu Hong's Yamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the Golden Drums were ringing, and the soldiers killed into the private office. Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured early. The Prime Minister handed down a military order to tie Liu Hong and his men to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister went straight into the main hall of the government office and sat down. Please ask the young lady to come out and meet. If the young lady wants to stay and go out, she will hang herself if she is ashamed of her father. Hearing this, Xuanzang hurriedly rescued his mother, knelt down on his knees and said to his mother, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Son and grandfather, unify the troops here and avenge your father. Today, the thief has been captured. Why did my mother want to die? If the mother dies, how can the child survive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister also went to the government to persuade him. The young lady said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I heard that the woman died from one thing. Tongfu has been killed by thieves, how can he be ashamed of being a thief? Because of the posthumous body, had to endure shame to steal life. Today, Xing'er has grown up and seen his old father take revenge for his daughter. What will he see! Only death can repay her husband's ear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is not my son's change of course with ups and downs. It is all because of a last resort. Why should I be ashamed!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Father and son hugged and cried, and Xuanzang also mourned. The Prime Minister wiped away his tears and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You two should stop worrying. I have captured the enemy thief now, and I will send it off.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That is, I got up and went to the Dharma Field. It happened that Jiangzhou Tongzhi also sent sentinels to take the water thief Li Biao.The prime minister was overjoyed and immediately ordered the soldiers to bring Liu Hong and Li Biao forward. Each was flogged severely with one hundred strokes, after which they confessed under duress, admitting their conspiracy years ago to murder Chen Guangrui. First, Li Biao was nailed onto a wooden donkey, dragged to the marketplace, and executed by being sliced into a thousand pieces, his head then displayed publicly as a warning. Next, Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang ferry crossing, the very spot where he had killed Chen Guangrui years ago. The prime minister, accompanied by the young lady and Xuanzang, personally went to the riverside, offering prayers toward the heavens. They then cruelly gouged out Liu Hong's heart and liver, using them as offerings for Guangrui, and burned a memorial text as part of the ritual.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe three stood by the river weeping bitterly, an act that soon alarmed the underwater realm. A sea patrol Yaksha quickly presented the memorial text to the Dragon King. After reading it, the Dragon King dispatched General Bie Wu to summon Guangrui. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sir,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said the Dragon King, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"congratulations! Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all at the riverside paying tribute to you. I shall now restore your soul. Moreover, I offer you one如意珠, two walking beads, ten lengths of fine silk, and a beaded jade belt. Today, you shall finally reunite with your wife, child, and mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui bowed repeatedly in gratitude. The Dragon King then instructed the Yaksha to carry Guangrui's body out of the river mouth and restore his soul. The Yaksha accepted the order and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin had finished mourning her husband and was about to throw herself into the water to end her life, but Xuanzang desperately grabbed hold of her, preventing her from doing so. In the midst of this chaos, suddenly a corpse floated up on the water's surface, drifting close to the riverbank. Miss Yin hurried forward to examine it and recognized her husband's body, bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone gathered around to watch, and they saw Guangrui slowly stretching his fists and legs, his body gradually coming back to life. Suddenly, he sat up, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Guangrui opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin, his father-in-law Prime Minister Yin, and the little monk all weeping beside him. Guangrui asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are you all here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Miss Yin replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Because you were murdered by bandits, and later I gave birth to our son. Fortunately, he was raised by the abbot of Jinshan Temple and eventually found me. I sent him to seek out your father, who learned of your fate and petitioned the court. He led troops here, captured the bandits, and just now, they took your heart and liver as offerings to you. I never imagined you would come back to life!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui explained, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's all because years ago, when we were at the Wanhuadeng shop, I bought and released that golden carp. Little did I know that carp was actually the Dragon King of these waters. When the villain pushed me into the river, it was thanks to him that I survived. Now he has restored my soul and bestowed upon me these treasures. And I never expected you to give birth to our son, nor that my father-in-law would avenge me. Truly, after enduring so much hardship, sweet happiness has finally arrived—a joy beyond measure!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpon hearing the news, all the officials came to congratulate them. The prime minister ordered a banquet to be prepared, thanking his subordinates before the army began its return journey. Arriving at Wanhuadeng, the prime minister ordered the troops to set up camp. Guangrui, accompanied by Xuanzang, went to Liu's shop to find his mother-in-law. That night, she had a dream: a withered tree blossomed, and magpies chirped incessantly behind her house. She thought, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Could it be my grandson returning?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Before she could finish her thoughts, Guangrui and his son appeared at the door. The little monk pointed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that my grandmother?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Upon seeing his aged mother, Guangrui immediately knelt down and prostrated himself. Mother and son embraced, weeping bitterly, and recounted everything that had happened. After settling the bill at the inn, they set off for the capital. Upon entering the prime minister's residence, Guangrui, Miss Yin, his mother, and Xuanzang all met the lady of the house. Overjoyed, she ordered her servants to prepare a grand feast in celebration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe prime minister declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us call today's banquet the Reunion Feast.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It truly was a joyful family gathering.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next morning, Emperor Tang ascended the throne, and Prime Minister Yin stepped forward to report in detail all that had transpired, recommending Guangrui for high office. The emperor approved the recommendation and immediately appointed Chen E as a scholar, entrusting him with state affairs. Xuanzang resolved to devote himself to Zen meditation and was sent to practice at Hongfu Temple. Later, Miss Yin calmly took her own life, and Xuanzang returned to Jinshan Temple to express gratitude to Abbot Faming. As for what happened afterward, we shall leave that for the next installment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Chapter Nine: Yuan Shoucheng's Brilliant Calculation, Free from Selfish Intentions; the Old Dragon King's Foolish Scheme Violates Heavenly Law\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPoem:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA great city in the capital, truly worth beholding,\\\\\\\\nEight rivers flow around the four mountains.\\\\\\\\nHow many emperors rose from this place;\\\\\\\\nSince ancient times, the world speaks of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis chapter specifically describes the great city of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, the site where emperors of successive dynasties established their capitals. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, the land has been adorned with colorful flowers, and eight rivers flow around the city. Thirty-six flower-lined alleys and seventy-two music pavilions stand proudly.According to the map of Hua and Yi, the world’s foremost region truly is a land of extraordinary beauty. Now, Emperor Taizong Wen of the Tang Dynasty has ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Longji Zhenguan. It has already been thirteen years since his coronation, and the current year is Ji Si. Not to mention the heroic figures who stand before him, safeguarding the realm and stabilizing the country, nor those outstanding talents who fought bravely to expand its borders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of two virtuous men living by the Jing River outside Chang’an city: one is a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other a woodcutter named Li Ding. Both are scholars who failed the imperial examinations but are literate mountain folk. One day, after selling their firewood in Chang’an and trading the carp from their baskets, they entered an inn together, enjoyed themselves until half-drunk, each carrying a bottle, and slowly strolled back along the banks of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Brother Li, I think those who strive for fame end up sacrificing their bodies for it; those who chase profit lose themselves in pursuit of gain; those who accept titles sleep with tigers by their side; and those who bask in favor carry snakes up their sleeves. When you come down to it, we’re better off enjoying our serene waters and verdant mountains, living freely and carefree, content with simplicity, letting fate guide us.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding replied, “Brother Zhang, you make a valid point. But your beautiful waters aren’t as good as my lush mountains.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nZhang Shao retorted, “Your lush mountains aren’t as fine as my beautiful waters.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo prove his point, he quoted a poem titled “Die Lian Hua”:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“On misty waters stretching ten thousand li, a tiny boat drifts alone, quietly moored beneath a lone awning, the voice of Xi Shi lingers round about. Free from worldly cares, cleansed of greed and fame, I leisurely pluck reeds and smartweeds by the willow-lined shore. A few sand terns delight my eyes, in willow groves and reed bays, my wife and children laugh with joy. After a peaceful sleep, the winds and waves seem playful—no honor, no disgrace, no worries at all.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding countered, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Die Lian Hua’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In a stretch of cloud-covered woods, pines bloom profusely; silently I listen to the warbling birds, their tongues as skillful as flutes. The red fades, the green grows rich—the spring is warm, yet summer swiftly arrives. Then autumn comes easily, changing everything; golden flowers bloom, perfect for admiring. And soon winter arrives sharp as a finger snap, yet I roam free through all four seasons, unbothered by anyone.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman said, “Your lush mountains can’t compare to my beautiful waters. Let me share a ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to illustrate how much better off we are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In the fairyland of clouds and water, life is complete; a boat with oars laid across is my home. Fresh scales I slice, green turtles I cook; purple crabs steamed, red shrimp boiled. Green bamboo shoots, water plantain sprouts—water caltrops and lotus roots are even more delightful. Tender lotus roots, aged lotus seeds, tender celery leaves—water chestnuts, water bamboo, and bird’s-eye flowers.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter replied, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to show how much better we have it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Towering peaks reach toward the horizon, a thatched hut is my home. Cured chicken, goose, crab, and turtle—wild boar, roe deer, hare, and deer surpass fish and shrimp. Chinese toon leaves, yellow catalpa buds—bamboo shoots and mountain tea are even more splendid. Purple plums, red peaches, ripe apricots and plums, sweet pears, sour jujubes, osmanthus blossoms.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman insisted, “Your lush mountains really can’t compete with my beautiful waters. Here’s another ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A little boat drifts wherever it may, amid countless layers of misty waves, fearless and free. Casting hooks and nets, I catch fresh fish, not greasy or oily, yet delicious beyond compare; old wife and young child gather round for reunion. With plenty of fish, I head to Chang’an market, trade for fine wine, and drink myself into a stupor. My raincoat serves as blanket on the autumn river, snoring peacefully, without a care, unattached to worldly honors or riches.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter retorted, “Brother Zhang, your beautiful waters still can’t match the joy of my mountain life. Here’s a ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A few thatched huts built beneath the hills, pines, bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids—how lovely they are! Through forests and over ridges, I search for dry firewood, no one scolds me, I sell as I please, more or less depending on the world. With the money earned, I buy wine and drink at will, savoring freedom in earthenware bowls and porcelain cups. Drunken and drowsy, I lie beneath the pines, unburdened, unconcerned, indifferent to rise or fall in this mortal world.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman concluded, “Brother Li, your mountain life can’t match the joy of my riverside business. Here’s a ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“The red smartweed blooms profusely under moonlight, yellow reeds sway wildly in the breeze. The azure sky stretches far, the Chu River flows empty and clear, stirring the reflections of stars in the pond. Big fish swim in schools into the net, small mandarin fish cluster around the hook. Once caught, they taste especially rich when cooked—laughing and joking, I roam the rivers and lakes.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter responded, “Brother Zhang, your riverside life still can’t match the joy of my mountain business. Here’s another ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Withered leaves and dead vines fill the paths, broken branches and old bamboo cover the hills. Wild vines and dried kudzu twine wildly, I gather them, tie them up, and carry them off. Worm-eaten hollow elm and willow, wind-broken pine and nanmu trees—\\\\\\\\nI collect them, pile them up for winter’s cold, and trade them for wine and money.”The fisherman said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Though your mountain may be comparable, it still can't match the serene elegance of my waters. Here's a poem to prove it: As the tide ebbs, a lone boat drifts away; at night's deep hour, the oarsman's song fades off. Under the crescent moon, my raincoat brings such quiet charm—wakeful gulls startled, yet unable to rise; colorful clouds part in the sky. Lying idly on the reed isle, with nothing to do, I linger until the sun climbs three poles high. Following my heart's desire, I arrange my days as I please; while courtiers shiver waiting for the watchman's call, how could they compare to my carefree spirit?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your waters' tranquil grace cannot rival the deeper serenity of my green mountains, and here's another poem to attest: On autumn paths, I stride forth with axe in hand; in evening coolness, I return bearing my load. Wildflowers tucked into my hair bring even greater wonder—parting clouds, I find my way; waiting for the moon, I knock at the gate. My young son and mountain wife greet me with joyful smiles; on a bed of grass and wooden pillow, I stretch and rest. Steaming pears and cooking millet, I quickly prepare; new brew matures in jars—truly, this deepens my tranquil heart!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman continued, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These are merely our trades, our means of sustenance. You lack the joys I find in leisure time, as this poem shows: Leisurely watching white cranes fly across the sky, I moor my boat by the stream and close the green door. Leaning against the cabin, I teach my child to twist fishing lines, and after rowing, spread the nets out with my wife. With calm resolve, I truly sense the waves have stilled; at ease, I naturally feel the breeze grow mild. A green raincoat and bamboo hat I wear at will—far better than donning purple robes in court.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yet your leisure time still doesn't match mine, as this poem also proves: Leisurely watching wispy clouds drift by, I sit alone in my thatched hut, closing the bamboo door. Without tasks, I instruct my child to read from scrolls; sometimes, I gather friends to play chess. When joy comes, I lean on my staff and sing along fragrant paths; when inspiration strikes, I carry my zither up to verdant heights. Straw sandals, hemp ropes, coarse cloth for bedding—such contentment far surpasses fine silken robes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Li Ding, we truly can enjoy light verses together without needing drums or golden goblets. Let's exchange a few lines each, and see how well we fishermen and woodcutters converse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Li Ding replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Zhang speaks most wisely; please begin with a verse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My boat rests in emerald waters amid misty ripples, my home lies deep in mountains and wild fields. I especially love spring floods over stream bridges, and most cherish morning mists among rocky peaks. Fresh carp from Longmen often graced my pot, dry firewood charred under daily flames. Fishing nets provide various ways to support old age, carrying poles sustain me till the end. In my small boat, I lie back watching geese take flight, along grassy paths slanting, listening to cranes cry out. In the marketplace of words, I hold no stake; in seas of right and wrong, my trace grows faint. By the stream, cloths hang drying like brocade, on stones I sharpen axes sharp as blades. Under autumn moons, I often fish alone; in spring mountains, no one meets me in solitude. When fish abound, I trade them for wine to share with my wife; leftover firewood sells to buy more liquor for my children. Singing and sipping freely, I let loose and roam; long songs and sighs, I yield to winds that toss and turn. Calling brothers and shipmates, I invite fellow travelers; friends and companions gather with rustic folk. Drinking games and fist-clenching contests pass cups repeatedly; card games and wordplay fill the hours with laughter. Cooking shrimp and crabs brings daily delight, stir-frying duck and braising chicken makes every day rich. My simple wife brews tea with playful ease, my mountain wife cooks meals with calm assurance. At dawn, I raise my staff to stir gentle waves, at sunrise, I carry firewood over rushing streams. After rain, I don my raincoat to catch live carp; in wind, I wield my axe to fell dead pines. Hiding from the world, I feign foolishness and dullness, concealing my name and living mute and deaf.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Li, I took the liberty of starting first; now it's your turn—please begin a couplet, and I shall follow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A madman of mountains and wilds, pretending madness in wind and moonlight, an old man lingering proudly in rivers and lakes. Free time belongs to those who live carefree lives, free from gossip, rejoicing in peace. On moonlit nights, I sleep soundly in a thatched hut; in dusk, a light bamboo cloak shields my body. Lost in joy, I make friends with pine and plum, gladly pledge with gulls and egrets. No schemes for fame and fortune occupy my mind; no sounds of strife reach my ears. A sip of fragrant homemade wine at any hour, three meals of wild vegetable soup each day. Two bundles of firewood sustain my life, a fishing rod provides my livelihood. I casually call my child to sharpen steel axes, quietly summon my simple lad to mend old cloths. In spring, I love watching willows turn green, when seasons blend, I delight in reeds and rushes. In summer, I escape the heat by tending new bamboo shoots, in June, I cool off picking tender water caltrops. When frost descends, chickens grow plump and ready for slaughter, on Double Ninth Festival, crabs thrive and are cooked just in time. In winter, I still sleep late as the sun rises, through the Nine Cold Days, I stay warm without steaming. Through all eight seasons, I let my nature run free in the mountains; in four seasons, I indulge my heart by the lake. Gathering firewood brings the joy of immortals, fishing bears no mark of worldly ties. Outside my door, wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues; before my boat, green waters ripple smoothly. Content in my humble state, I need not speak of high office; my settled nature surpasses even a city ten miles wide.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“Ten miles of city walls, high defenses and strict orders; three high officials, their status renowned, listening to imperial edicts. To enjoy mountains and waters is truly rare—how grateful we are to Heaven, Earth, and the gods!” As they exchanged verses and linked their poetic lines, they reached the point where their paths diverged and bowed farewell to each other. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, take care on your journey! Be cautious when climbing the mountain, watch out for tigers. If any danger should arise, tomorrow’s street might see one less old friend!” Upon hearing this, Li Ding flew into a rage: “You lazy scoundrel! True friends share life and death together—how dare you curse me like that? If I meet with harm from a tiger, you’ll surely face the waves and be swept away by the river!” Zhang Shao replied, “I swear I’ll never be tossed about by rivers again.” Li Ding retorted, “Heaven holds unpredictable storms, and fate brings temporary fortune or misfortune. How can you guarantee you’ll remain unscathed?” Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, though you speak thus, you haven’t grasped the truth; my business, at least, offers some certainty—I’m certain I won’t encounter such trouble.” Li Ding asked, “Your livelihood on the water is extremely dangerous and perilous, shrouded in mystery and obscurity—what certainty can there be?” Zhang Shao replied, “You simply don’t understand. In Chang’an city, on West Gate Street, there’s a fortune-teller who sells divination. Every day I bring him a golden carp, and he secretly passes me a lesson, guiding me by direction, always hitting the mark. Today I went to buy another reading, and he instructed me to cast my net east of Jinghe Bay’s bend and set my line along the western bank—surely I’ll return with a boatload of fish and shrimp. Tomorrow I’ll come into the city, sell my catch, buy wine, and meet up with you again.” With these words, the two parted ways.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they spoke, someone was lurking in the grass. It turned out that a night demon patrolling the waters of the Jing River had overheard the talk about hitting the mark every time. He quickly rushed back to the Crystal Palace and urgently reported to the Dragon King:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Trouble! Trouble!” The Dragon King asked, “What kind of trouble?” The night demon replied, “While patrolling the riverbank, I heard two fishermen chatting. As they parted, their words were quite alarming. One fisherman said there’s a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an city who makes the most accurate predictions. Every day he gives him a carp, and the fortune-teller secretly teaches him how to hit the mark every single time. If his predictions prove true, won’t he end up wiping out all the aquatic creatures? How then can our underwater palace maintain its splendor, and how can we continue leaping through waves and assisting Your Majesty’s power?” The Dragon King was furious and immediately drew his sword, ready to march on Chang’an and destroy this fortune-teller. But just then, dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp ministers and crab officials, shad generals, mandarin fish lieutenants, and carp prime ministers stepped forward and jointly petitioned:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Your Majesty, please calm down. As the saying goes, words heard casually should not be taken at face value. If Your Majesty goes now, clouds will surely gather, rain will surely fall, and the people of Chang’an may be frightened, drawing blame from Heaven. Your Majesty’s presence is mysterious and unpredictable, capable of infinite transformations—but why not simply transform into a scholar and visit Chang’an yourself? If such a person exists, we can deal with him later; but if he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be unjust to harm others unnecessarily?” The Dragon King heeded their advice, laid down his sword, refrained from summoning clouds or rain, stepped ashore, and transformed himself into a scholar dressed in white, truly majestic and imposing, towering above the valleys and reaching toward the sky. His gait was dignified and proper, his conduct precise and upright. His speech followed Confucius and Mencius, his manners reflected the elegance of King Wen of Zhou. He wore a jade-colored robe and a leisurely headscarf with a single character embroidered on it. Setting off, he strode through the clouds and arrived directly on West Gate Street in Chang’an. There he saw a crowd gathered, bustling and noisy, filled with lively discussions: “Those born in the Year of the Dragon clash with those born in the Year of the Tiger. Though the combinations of Yin-Chen-Si-Hai are considered harmonious, what’s feared is the day clashing with the ruler of the year.” Hearing this, the Dragon King realized this must be the fortune-teller’s place. He stepped forward, pushed through the crowd, and peered inside. What he saw was a room adorned with pearls and jewels on all four walls, rich brocade and silk filling the hall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fragrance of precious incense never ceased, and the porcelain bottles held crystal-clear water. On either side hung paintings by Wang Wei, while above the seat hung an image of Guiguzi.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Duanxi inkstone, golden smoke ink, matched perfectly with a brush of frosty bristles; the Fire Pearl Forest and Guo Pu’s numerology stood beside the newly revised court texts. Six Lines mastered thoroughly, Eight Trigrams understood perfectly. Able to know heaven and earth, skilled at discerning spirits and gods. A compass arranged noon and midnight precisely, a belly full of stars clearly arrayed. Indeed, future events and past matters were as clear as moonlit mirrors; which families prospered and which declined, judged as clearly as divine insight. Foreseeing misfortune and determining good fortune, pronouncing death and proclaiming life. Speaking swiftly as wind and rain, writing so that ghosts and gods trembled. The sign read: “Divine Lessons, Master Yuan Shoucheng.” Who was this man? He turned out to be none other than Yuan Shoucheng, uncle of Yuan Tiangang, the current Imperial Astronomer and Chief of the Bureau of Astronomy.Indeed, the gentleman had an extraordinary appearance, graceful demeanor, and his fame spread throughout the land; his skills were unrivaled in Chang'an. The Dragon King entered and met with the gentleman. After exchanging formal greetings, he invited the Dragon to take a seat, and a young attendant presented tea. The gentleman then asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What brings you here today?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've come to consult you about the weather forecast for tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman immediately drew a divination chart from his sleeve and declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Clouds obscure the mountaintops, mist veils the treetops. If you're asking about rain, it will surely fall tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King pressed further, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At what exact time will it rain tomorrow? And how much rainfall can we expect?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tomorrow at Chen hour clouds will gather, at Si hour thunder will roll, at Wu hour rain will begin, and by Wei hour the rain will be sufficient, totaling three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This cannot be taken lightly! If it truly rains tomorrow according to your predicted timing and amount, I'll reward you with fifty taels of gold as a token of gratitude. But if it doesn't rain, or if the timing or amount is even slightly off, let me tell you plainly—I'll smash your facade, tear down your signboard, and drive you out of Chang'an immediately, never again allowed to deceive the people!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman cheerfully responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Very well, I accept your challenge. Please rest assured, the rain will certainly arrive tomorrow as predicted.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Dragon King took his leave, departed Chang'an, and returned to the Water Palace. The lesser water deities greeted him and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How was your visit to that fortune-teller?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh yes, indeed! What a smooth-talking fellow! I asked him when it would rain, and he confidently predicted tomorrow's rain. When I pressed him for specific times and amounts, he said clouds would form at Chen hour, thunder would strike at Si hour, rain would start at Wu hour, and by Wei hour the rainfall would reach three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points. So I made a wager with him: if his prediction comes true, I'll give him fifty taels of gold as a reward; but if there's even the slightest discrepancy, I'll destroy his facade, kick him out, and forbid him from ever deceiving people in Chang'an again!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The aquatic creatures all laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty is the Grand Master of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God in charge of rain—only you know whether it will rain or not. How dare he speak such nonsense? That fortune-teller is sure to lose! He's bound to lose!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the dragon princes, grandsons, and fish, carp, and crabs were still laughing and discussing this matter, they suddenly heard a voice echoing from mid-air: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial decree!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Everyone looked up and saw a golden-clad warrior holding an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, heading straight toward the Water Palace. Startled, the Dragon King quickly straightened his robes, lit incense, and respectfully received the decree.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the golden-clad warrior returned to the heavens, the Dragon King expressed his gratitude, opened the sealed document, and read aloud: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Imperial Edict to the General of the Eight Rivers, commanding thunder and lightning; tomorrow you shall bestow rain to benefit the city of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The edict precisely matched the timing and rainfall amounts predicted by the gentleman, leaving the Dragon King utterly shaken and terrified. After regaining his composure, he addressed the aquatic beings: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There truly are such spiritual individuals in this world! He truly possesses the ability to communicate with heaven and earth—there's no disputing it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe strategist Shiji reported, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty, rest assured. What difficulty could there be in defeating him? I have a small plan that will silence that fellow once and for all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King asked for details, and the strategist replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If we alter the timing of the rain slightly and reduce the amount just a bit, his predictions will clearly be inaccurate. Won't that be enough to prove him wrong? Then we can tear down his signboard, chase him away, and there'll be no trouble at all!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King approved the strategy without hesitation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, he summoned Feng Bo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu, and ascended into the nine heavens above Chang'an. At the appointed time, clouds began to form at Si hour, thunder rumbled at Wu hour, rain fell at Wei hour, and finally ceased at Shen hour—but the total rainfall amounted to only three feet and forty points, one hour earlier than predicted and three inches and eight points less than promised. After issuing orders for his generals to withdraw, he transformed himself back into the guise of a refined scholar dressed in white and headed straight for Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling shop on West Gate Street. Without a word, he smashed the shop's signboard, brush, inkstone, and everything else. Meanwhile, the gentleman calmly sat in his chair, completely unfazed. The Dragon King then picked up a door panel and began striking and shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You deceitful charlatan who spreads false prophecies and misleads the masses! Your divinations are useless, your words absurd! Today's predicted timing and rainfall don't match reality, yet you still sit there boldly. Leave now, or I'll spare your life no longer!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Yet Shoucheng remained utterly fearless, raising his head to the sky and coldly laughing, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've committed no crime, but you, on the other hand, very much have! You may fool others, but you can't fool me. I know exactly who you are—you're not a scholar at all, but the Dragon King of the Jing River. You violated the Jade Emperor's decree by altering the timing and reducing the rainfall, thus breaking heavenly law!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“You’re standing on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, where a fatal blow is inevitable—yet you still dare to scold me here?” Upon hearing this, the Dragon King was seized with fear, his hair standing on end. Hastily dropping the door panel, he straightened his clothes, bowed deeply, and knelt before the master, saying, “Please don’t take offense, Master. Those earlier words were merely spoken in jest; who could have foreseen that falsehood would become reality, and that I’d truly violated heavenly law? What can be done now? I beg you, Master, please save me!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t let you go.” Shoucheng replied, “I cannot save you myself, but I can point out a path for you to reincarnate.” The dragon said, “I humbly request your guidance.” The master continued, “Tomorrow at the third hour of noon, you are scheduled to appear before Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official, to be executed. If you truly wish to keep your life, you must quickly go and plead with Emperor Taizong of Tang, who reigns today. Wei Zheng is the chancellor under the Tang emperor; only by gaining his personal favor can you ensure safety.” Hearing this, the Dragon King bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnaware of how time had passed, the sun had already set in the west, and the moon rose high in the sky. One could see: mist condensed, mountains turned purple, crows weary as they returned home; travelers far from home sought refuge in inns. New geese perched on sandbanks by the ferry landing, and the Milky Way appeared. The watchman urged the passing of the night, while in the lonely village, lamplight flickered without flame. Smoke curled gently from hearths in quiet monasteries, and within butterfly dreams, people vanished from sight. The moon shifted, casting flower shadows onto the railing, stars twinkled wildly. The sound of dripping water marked the hours, and before one knew it, the deep night had already reached its midpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King of the Jing River did not return to his underwater palace. Instead, he remained in mid-air, waiting until around midnight, when he gathered his clouds and dispersed his mists, heading straight for the entrance of the imperial palace. At that very moment, Emperor Taizong was dreaming he had stepped outside the palace gates, walking beneath the moonlit flowers. Suddenly, the Dragon King transformed into human form and knelt before him, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong asked, “Who are you? How can I save you?” The Dragon King replied, “Your Majesty is a true dragon, while I am an ordinary dragon. Because I’ve broken heavenly law, I’m due to be executed by Your Majesty’s virtuous minister, Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. That’s why I’ve come to beg you—I implore Your Majesty to save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong said, “If Wei Zheng is to carry out the execution, then I can indeed save you. Go with peace of mind.” Overjoyed, the Dragon King bowed deeply in gratitude and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, after waking from his dream, Emperor Taizong couldn’t stop thinking about it. By dawn, at the third watch, Taizong convened court, gathering officials from both civil and military ranks. There, one could see:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmoke veiled the Phoenix Pavilion, fragrant incense filled the Dragon Tower. Light shimmered on the vermilion throne, clouds brushed past the emerald canopy. Ruler and ministers harmonized as though they were Yao and Shun, ritual music and decorum approached the grandeur of Han and Zhou. Courtiers held lamps, palace maids fanned themselves, their reflections glowing brightly; peacock screens and Kylin halls sparkled everywhere. All cried out “Long live the Emperor!” and offered blessings for ten thousand years. Three silent whips cracked, and all bowed in ceremonial attire before the imperial crown. Palace flowers bloomed brilliantly, their heavenly fragrance filling the air; willows along the embankment swayed gently, accompanied by imperial music. Pearl curtains and jade drapes hung high, secured by golden hooks; dragon-and-phoenix fans and mountain-and-river banners adorned the royal carriage as it paused. Civil officials stood elegant and refined, military generals proud and alert. The imperial road distinguished high from low, and ranks lined up on the vermilion platform. Golden seals and purple ribbons honored three great elephants, symbolizing enduring prosperity for countless ages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce the officials had finished their greetings and dispersed into their respective groups, Emperor Taizong, with eyes like phoenixes and dragon pupils, carefully examined each one from head to toe. Among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui, and others; among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaogin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, Qin Shubao, and many more—all dignified and solemn, yet Wei Zheng, the chancellor, was conspicuously absent. Emperor Taizong summoned Xu Shiji to the throne and said, “Last night, I had a strange dream. I dreamed someone came forward to pay homage, claiming to be the Dragon King of the Jing River, who had broken heavenly law and was due to be executed by Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. He begged me to save him, and I promised to do so. Yet today, Wei Zheng is nowhere to be seen among the officials assembled. Why is that?”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShiji replied, “This dream must be taken seriously. Wei Zheng will arrive shortly; Your Majesty must not let him leave the palace. Only by keeping him here for another day can we save the dragon from the dream.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDelighted, Emperor Taizong immediately issued an edict, ordering the imperial messenger to summon Wei Zheng to court.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Wei Zheng was at home, observing the celestial signs at night, burning precious incense, when suddenly he heard the cry of cranes echoing from the nine heavens. It was an envoy sent by Heaven, bearing a golden decree from the Jade Emperor, instructing him to execute the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream at the third hour of noon. Grateful for Heaven’s grace, Wei Zheng had already fasted and bathed, testing his wisdom sword and summoning his spiritual essence within his residence, which is why he hadn’t attended court. When the imperial messenger arrived with the decree, he was overcome with fear and anxiety, yet dared not disobey the emperor’s command. Thus, he hastily dressed and belted himself, taking the decree with him as he hurried to court, where he prostrated himself before the emperor and confessed his guilt.Emperor Tang issued an edict, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I hereby pardon you and declare you innocent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At that time, the ministers had not yet adjourned the court session. However, upon hearing these words, the emperor ordered the curtains to be drawn back and dismissed the assembly, leaving only Wei Zheng behind. He was summoned to the Golden Hall and then invited into the private audience chamber, where they first discussed strategies for ensuring peace within the realm and plans for stabilizing the country. As it neared the end of the fourth hour and the beginning of the fifth, the emperor instructed a palace attendant to bring out a large chessboard, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us play a game, my wise minister.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The imperial consorts promptly brought forth the chessboard and set it up on the royal desk. Wei Zheng gratefully accepted the honor and immediately began playing chess with Emperor Tang.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for the outcome of the game, we shall leave that for the next installment to reveal.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"usage\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"inputTokens\\\\\\\":1004,\\\\\\\"outputTokens\\\\\\\":1261,\\\\\\\"totalTokens\\\\\\\":2265}},\\\\\\\"httpStatusCode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"requestId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"C2D45266-3135-1A06-AD7F-69E782ED596F\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\":true},\\\\\\\"headers\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"access-control-allow-origin\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"*\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Fri, 12 Sep 2025 07:58:46 GMT\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"vary\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Accept-Encoding\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"x-acs-request-id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"C2D45266-3135-1A06-AD7F-69E782ED596F\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content-type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"application/json;charset=utf-8\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"access-control-expose-headers\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"*\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"x-acs-trace-id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"20ab10e70295f6562ada5fe8d9f3eca7\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"statusCode\\\\\\\":200}\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\\\\"body\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"data\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"translation\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"I ask: how many countless inquiries have we made at the Zen gate, only to find ourselves aged in vain at last? Grinding bricks into mirrors, piling up snow for sustenance—how many youthful years have we thus lost in delusion? Swallowing the vast ocean with a hair, fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed—why do we still wear golden crowns and forced smiles? When enlightenment dawns, we transcend the ten stages and three vehicles; yet if we linger, we remain trapped within the four realms of existence and six paths. Who has heard, beneath the shadowless tree before the cliff of utter emptiness, the cuckoo’s cry heralding spring’s dawn? The Caosi trail is perilous, and the clouds over Jiling run deep; here, old friends’ voices fade away. On cliffs of thousand-zhang ice, five-petaled lotuses bloom, and incense curls from the ancient temple’s hanging curtains. At that moment, when we discern the source and stream, we shall behold the Dragon King’s Three Treasures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis poem is titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Su Wu Slow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It tells of our Buddha, Shakyamuni, bidding farewell to the Jade Emperor and returning to the sacred abode of Leiyin. There, he found three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great vajras, and countless bodhisattvas, each holding banners, canopies, wondrous treasures, and celestial flowers, arrayed in the spiritual realm of Spirit Mountain beneath the twin banyan trees to greet him. Ascending upon auspicious clouds, Shakyamuni addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"With profound wisdom, I have manifested throughout the three realms. The fundamental nature is ultimately tranquil and extinguished, identical to the void, devoid of all things. To subdue the rebellious monkey was no easy task; few could comprehend it. Birth and death begin with names, and phenomena are as they appear.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Having spoken, he emitted rays of sarira light, filling the sky with forty-two radiant white rainbows stretching north and south. Upon seeing this, the crowd prostrated themselves in reverence. Soon after, auspicious clouds gathered, forming a lotus throne of supreme quality, upon which he sat serenely. The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight vajras, and four bodhisattvas approached, palms joined in prayer, and asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who was it that stirred up chaos in Heaven and disturbed the peach banquet?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Shakyamuni replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That fellow is a demonic monkey born on Flower Fruit Mountain, whose crimes are immeasurable and beyond description. Even the heavenly generals could not subdue him, though Erlang captured him. Even Laozi's fiery refining could not harm him. When I arrived, he was amidst the thunder gods, flaunting his might and spirit. I stopped the fighting, questioned him about his origins. He claimed supernatural powers, the ability to transform, and to ride the somersault cloud, covering one hundred and eight thousand li in a single leap. We made a wager: if he couldn't escape my grasp, I would seize him and imprison him under Five Elements Mountain. The Five Emperors opened their golden palaces and jade chambers, inviting me to take the chief seat and holding a grand assembly to honor me, after which I departed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe crowd rejoiced upon hearing this, praising him profusely. After expressing gratitude, they dispersed into their respective groups, each resuming their duties and enjoying pure bliss. Indeed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAuspicious mists fill the land of India, rainbow light surrounds the honored one. In the West, he is called first—the formless Dharma King! Often we see mystical monkeys offering fruit, deer carrying flowers; green phoenixes dance, colorful phoenixes sing; sacred turtles present longevity, cranes capture medicinal herbs. Enjoying the Pure Land of Jetavana, partaking in the dragon palace's realm of Dharma. Flowers bloom daily, fruits ripen at every hour, cultivating tranquility and returning to truth, practicing Zen with genuine results. Neither annihilation nor birth, neither increase nor decrease. Mist and rosy clouds drift freely back and forth, unaffected by cold or heat, time itself forgotten.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the poem says:\\\\\\\\nFree to come and go, carefree and at ease, free from fear and sorrow. In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, all is open and clear; in the great thousandfold world, there is neither spring nor autumn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, while residing between the sacred mountain of Leiyin and the moonlit Spirit Mountain, the Buddha summoned all the Buddhas, Arhats, protectors, bodhisattvas, vajras, monks, nuns, and others, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since subduing the rebellious monkey and pacifying Heaven, I have remained unaware of the passage of time, yet I estimate half a millennium has passed in the mortal realm, and now it is the full-moon day of early autumn. I possess a precious basin filled with a hundred varieties of flowers and a thousand kinds of exotic fruits, among other treasures. How shall we celebrate this 'Ullambana Festival' together with the Dharma?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Each member of the assembly joined their palms, bowed three times before the Buddha, and understood his intention. Then, Shakyamuni instructed Ananda to carry the basin of flowers and fruits, while Ksitigarbha scattered offerings, filling the crowd with gratitude. Everyone offered poems in thanks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of blessings says:\\\\\\\\nBlessings shine brightly before the revered one, blessings embrace the depths and extend far and wide. Boundless virtue endures as long as the earth, blessed connections link us to heaven. Fields of blessing expand yearly, the sea of fortune grows deeper with each passing year. Blessings fill the universe, abundant shade and endless growth, ever complete and boundless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of prosperity says:\\\\\\\\nProsperity weighs as heavily as mountains, the colorful phoenix sings its song. Prosperity brings timely good fortune, like the evening star shining brightly. Adding ten thousand measures of wealth ensures health and well-being, enjoying a thousand vessels of peace. Salaries rival heaven, eternally secure, names as vast as the sea, ever clearer. Thoughts of prosperity inspire admiration, titles of honor spread glory across myriad nations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The longevity poem says:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The star of longevity presents colorful offerings to the Buddha. From here, the realm of longevity shines with splendor. Plates brimming with fruits of longevity emit auspicious radiance, and freshly picked flowers of longevity adorn the lotus pedestal. The poems of longevity are elegant and full of wonders, while the melodies of longevity harmonize beautifully with talented voices. Longevity extends as long as the sun and moon, and may it be as vast and serene as mountains and seas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\After all the Bodhisattvas finished their offerings, they respectfully requested the Buddha to clearly explain the fundamental principles and trace the origins. The Buddha slightly opened his compassionate mouth, expounded the great Dharma, and proclaimed the true fruit, lecturing on the profound scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the perfection of the Five Skandhas. At that moment, heavenly dragons circled around, and flowers rained down in profusion. Indeed: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Zen mind brightly illuminates the moon over a thousand rivers, and true nature embraces the vastness of ten thousand miles of sky.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After finishing his lecture, the Buddha addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the four great continents I now manifest, sentient beings differ in goodness and evil from place to place. In the Eastern Continent of Jambudvipa, people revere heaven and earth, with clear minds and calm spirits. In the Northern Continent of Uttarakuru, though fond of their own kin, they merely struggle for survival, possessing simple natures and limited aspirations, rarely indulging in excess. In the Western Continent of Aparagodaniya, people neither covet nor kill, nurturing their qi and cultivating inner spirit; though lacking supreme truth, everyone enjoys a long life. But in the Southern Continent of Kalirupa, greed, lust, and delight in misfortune prevail, with much killing and strife—truly a battlefield of tongues and a sea of slander and evil. Now I have the Tripitaka scriptures, which can persuade people to do good.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Upon hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas clasped their hands in reverence and approached the Buddha, asking: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are the three collections of the Tripitaka scriptures?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have one collection of Dharma, discussing heaven; one collection of Vinaya, speaking of earth; and one collection of Sutra, guiding ghosts. Together, these three collections comprise thirty-five volumes, totaling 15,144 scrolls, representing the path to cultivation and the gateway to righteousness. I intend to send them to the Eastern Land, but alas, the beings there are foolish, slandering the true words and failing to understand the essence of my teachings, neglecting the authentic Yoga tradition. How can we find someone powerful enough to journey to the Eastern Land, seek out a sincere believer, guide him through hardships across thousands of mountains and distant waters, bring him to me to obtain the true scriptures, and perpetually spread them in the Eastern Land? This would indeed be a blessing as vast as mountains and a fortune as deep as the sea. Who would be willing to undertake such a journey?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At this point, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva stepped forward to the lotus pedestal, bowed three times before the Buddha, and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your disciple, though unworthy, is willing to go to the Eastern Land and find someone to retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" All present looked up at the Bodhisattva:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Perfect in virtue and wisdom, his golden body is filled with intelligence. Beaded garlands hang gracefully, fragrant rings gleam with precious light, dark clouds cleverly form coiled dragons, and embroidered ribbons gently flutter like colorful phoenix feathers. A jade clasp adorns his plain silk robe, surrounded by auspicious radiance; a brocade skirt and golden cords bring forth auspicious energy. His brows resemble crescent moons, his eyes like twin stars. Five faces naturally express joy, and his vermilion lips are touched with a hint of red. The vase of pure nectar overflows year after year, and the willow branch inserted askew remains ever green. He resolves eight difficulties and saves countless beings with great compassion; thus he dwells atop great mountains, resides in the South Sea, rescues those in suffering by responding to their cries, universally praised and answered, revered by thousands of saints and spirits. His heart delights in purple bamboo, and his nature cherishes fragrant vines. He is the compassionate lord of Mount Luojia, the living Avalokiteshvara in the Cave of Tidal Sounds.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Seeing this, the Buddha was overjoyed and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No one else can go; only the venerable Avalokiteshvara, with his vast supernatural powers, is capable of undertaking this mission.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If I go to the Eastern Land, do you have any instructions for me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On this journey, you must carefully examine the roads, not traveling through the heavens, but rather among clouds and mists. As you pass mountains and rivers, remember the distances and details of the route, and give careful guidance to the scripture seeker. Fearing that the sincere believer may find the journey difficult, I shall provide you with five treasures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Then he ordered Ananda and Kashyapa to bring forth a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"brocade kasaya robe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nine-ringed staff,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" handing them to the Bodhisattva and saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This robe and staff can be personally used by the scripture seeker. If he comes here with firm resolve, wearing my robe will prevent him from falling into reincarnation, and holding my staff will protect him from harm.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The Bodhisattva received these items with reverence, and the Buddha then took three headbands and handed them to the Bodhisattva, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These treasures are called 'tightening bands.' Though there are three identical ones, each is used differently. I have three incantations of 'Golden Tightening Seal.' If on the road you encounter powerful demons, you must persuade them to reform and become disciples of the scripture seeker. If they refuse to obey, you may place this band on their head, and it will naturally take root in their flesh. By reciting the appropriate incantation, their eyes will swell, their head will ache, and their foreheads will split open, forcing them to enter my fold.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing these words, the Bodhisattva joyfully bowed and stepped back, immediately summoning Huai'an the Pilgrim to accompany him. Huai'an wielded a solid iron staff weighing a thousand jin, serving as a mighty demon-slaying warrior at the Bodhisattva's side. The Bodhisattva then wrapped the Mirror Lake Robe into a bundle and instructed Huai'an to carry it on his back. Concealing the golden ring, the Bodhisattva took up his copper clapper and set off directly down from Spirit Mountain. This journey would bring about a significant outcome: the Buddha's disciple would return to fulfill his original vow, and Elder Golden Cicada would wrap himself in sandalwood robes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain, he was greeted by the Great Immortal of the Golden Summit at Yuzhen Temple, who stood at the temple gate to offer tea. The Bodhisattva dared not linger long and said to the Great Immortal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have received the Buddha's command to travel eastward to seek out the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Great Immortal asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"When will this pilgrim arrive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is uncertain—perhaps within two or three years, or possibly sooner.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" With that, he bade farewell to the Great Immortal, traveling through clouds and mist, carefully noting the route along the way. A poem bears witness to this journey:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Seeking across ten thousand miles without a word,\\\\\\\\nWho can claim complete success when desire remains unfulfilled?\\\\\\\\nTo seek others seems so effortless—\\\\\\\\nIs this not fate, destined for me all my life?\\\\\\\\nThe Way is taught with methods, yet without faith, even truth becomes empty rumor.\\\\\\\\nI pledge my heart and soul to find companionship;\\\\\\\\nI know surely ahead lies an encounter meant by destiny.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs master and disciple continued their journey, they suddenly came upon the Weak Water River, a vast expanse marking the boundary of the Quicksand River. The Bodhisattva remarked:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My disciple, this place proves truly difficult to traverse. How could a mortal with impure flesh and blood possibly cross over?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Huai'an asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Master, how far does this river stretch?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As the Bodhisattva paused to gaze, he saw:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To the east it connects with sandy deserts, reaching both eastern and western lands; to the south it extends to Ugo, and to the north it leads to the Tartars. Eight hundred li lie along its length, while its breadth stretches for countless miles. The water flows like the earth turning over, and the waves surge like mountains rising on their backs. Vast and boundless, desolate and endless, its roar echoes for ten li, and its floodwaters rise ten thousand feet high. Even celestial rafts cannot reach here, nor can lotus leaves float upon its surface. Withered grasses bend beneath the slanting sun, yellow clouds obscure the long embankments. Who among merchants dares to travel here? Where do fishermen find shelter? On the flat sands no geese alight, and from distant shores come the cries of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know the beauty of this scene, and the delicate fragrance of white duckweed lingers faintly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the Bodhisattva surveyed the area, a loud splash erupted from the river, and a hideous demon leaped forth from the waters. Its appearance was truly monstrous:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIts skin neither green nor black, but dull and gloomy; its body neither tall nor short, barefoot and sinewy. Its eyes gleamed like twin lamps at the hearth, its mouth forked like a butcher's cleaver. Fangs protruded like blades, and fiery hair stood disheveled. It roared like thunder, and its feet moved swiftly as if driven by a rolling wind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster brandished a magical staff and rushed ashore, attempting to seize the Bodhisattva. But Huai'an blocked him with his solid iron club, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Halt!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster raised his staff in response, and the two clashed by the Quicksand River. This fierce battle was truly astonishing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMu Zha's iron club protected the righteous path, displaying divine power; the monster's demon-slaying staff fought valiantly. Two silver serpents danced along the riverbank, and two divine beings charged toward the shore. One wielded might over the Quicksand, demonstrating extraordinary skill; the other defended Guanyin, earning great merit. One leapt and splashed through the waves, while the other spewed mist and clouds. Waves and surges darkened the heavens, mist and clouds dimmed the sun and moon. That demon-slaying staff resembled a white tiger emerging from the mountains; this solid iron club was like a yellow dragon lying in wait. One advanced, parting snakes and stirring grass; the other swung wide, scattering hawks and splitting pines. The battle raged until darkness enveloped everything, stars shone brightly, and mist swirled, blurring heaven and earth. That one had long dwelled in the Weak Water, fierce and relentless; this one achieved his first great feat since leaving Spirit Mountain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two fought back and forth for dozens of rounds, evenly matched, with no clear victor. Finally, the monster blocked Mu Zha's iron club and demanded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, to dare confront me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am Mu Zha, the Second Prince of the Heavenly King Tota, known as Huai'an the Pilgrim. I now accompany my master on a journey to the Eastern Lands to seek the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures. Who are you, demon, to boldly block our path?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster suddenly realized, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I remember you practicing alongside Guanyin of the South Sea in the Bamboo Grove! Why have you come here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that Master standing on the shore?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHearing this, the monster stammered repeatedly, lowered his magical staff, and allowed Mu Zha to lead him before Guanyin. Prostrating himself, he pleaded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and listen to my confession. I am no evil spirit—I am the Scroll-Raising General, an attendant to the imperial carriage in the Celestial Palace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I accidentally broke a glass cup during the cricket peach banquet that the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes and banished me to the mortal realm, transforming me into this wretched form. Moreover, every seven days, he commands flying swords to pierce my chest and sides more than a hundred times before withdrawing. Thus, I suffer such torment. With no other choice, driven by unbearable hunger and cold, every two or three days I venture out into the waves to seek passersby for sustenance. Little did I expect today, through ignorance, to have offended the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You were guilty in Heaven, and now that you've been cast down, you continue to harm living beings—truly, sin upon sin. I have received Buddha's decree to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. Why don't you join my path, embrace virtuous fruit, become a disciple of that pilgrim, and accompany him westward to pay homage to the Buddha and obtain the sacred texts? Then I shall ensure the flying swords no longer pierce you. Once your mission is accomplished, you'll be absolved of guilt and restored to your original position. What say you?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am willing to embrace the righteous path.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Stepping forward, he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless humans here, and several pilgrims have passed by, all of whom I've consumed. Every time I ate someone, I tossed their head into the quicksand, where it sank straight to the bottom (a water so deep even goose feathers cannot float). Yet nine pilgrims' skulls floated on the surface, refusing to sink. Thinking them strange objects, I strung them together with a rope and kept them for amusement during idle moments. But now, if the pilgrims never reach this place, wouldn't that only hinder my own future prospects?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How could they possibly fail to arrive? You may hang those skulls above your head as a reminder, waiting patiently for the pilgrims; they will surely prove useful.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If that's the case, I gladly accept your guidance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred the precepts upon him, designated sand as his surname, and thus he became known as Sha Wujing. From that moment, he entered the monastic order, helped the Bodhisattva cross the river, purified his heart and mind, resolved never again to harm living beings, and dedicated himself solely to awaiting the pilgrim.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter bidding farewell to the monster, the Bodhisattva and Muzha set off directly toward the Eastern lands. After traveling for some time, they came upon another towering mountain shrouded in malevolent energy, making it impossible to climb. Just as they prepared to ride the clouds over the mountain, a sudden gust of wind arose, and another demon appeared. This demon was truly fearsome:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHis lips curled upward like lotus petals, his ears resembled giant fans, and his golden eyes gleamed fiercely. His tusks were sharp as steel files, and his gaping mouth seemed like a blazing brazier. A golden helmet tightly secured his cheeks, and armored scales adorned his body like a retreating python. In one hand, he wielded a spiked club resembling a dragon's claw, while a crescent-shaped bow hung from his waist, its ten arrows gleaming brightly. His imposing presence intimidated even the fiercest spirits, and his soaring ambition dwarfed the might of celestial gods. Without hesitation, he charged forward, aiming his spiked club at the Bodhisattva. But Muzha stepped in to block the attack, shouting loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You vile monster, how dare you behave so rudely! Take this!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The demon retorted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This monk doesn't know when to die! Here's my pitchfork!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" And so, beneath the mountain, the two clashed fiercely, battling to decide the victor. It was a truly fierce fight:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe demon was ferocious, yet Hui'an possessed great power. Iron clubs split hearts, and spiked drills met faces head-on. Dust and dirt filled the air, darkening heaven and earth, while flying rocks and debris startled ghosts and gods. The nine-pronged pitchfork gleamed brilliantly, its double rings ringing clearly; the iron staff was sleek and black, soaring through both hands. One was the prince of the Heavenly King, the other a valiant general spirit. One protected the law on Mount Putuo, the other dwelled as a demon in a cave. In this encounter, neither knew who would lose nor who would win.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the two were locked in battle, Guanyin appeared in mid-air, tossing down a lotus flower to separate the pitchfork and staff. Startled, the monster asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, daring to play tricks like 'flowers before my eyes' to deceive me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You mere mortal with fleshly eyes! I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. This lotus flower was thrown by my master—you can't even recognize it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Bodhisattva of the South Sea—is that Guanyin, who sweeps away three calamities and rescues from eight tribulations?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who else could it be?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster dropped his spiked club, bowed deeply, and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother, where is the Bodhisattva? Please trouble yourself to introduce me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuzha pointed upward and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't it right there?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster bowed repeatedly toward the sky, crying out loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive me! Forgive me!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGuanyin descended from the clouds and approached, asking, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What kind of wild boar transformed into a spirit are you, what sort of old pig wreaks havoc here, daring to block my way?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am neither a wild boar nor an old pig—I was originally Tianpeng, the Marshal of the Heavenly River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I teased Chang'e while drunk that the Jade Emperor struck me with two thousand hammer blows and banished me to the mortal realm. My true spirit, in a misguided attempt at rebirth, mistakenly entered the womb of a sow, resulting in this monstrous form. I bit and killed the sow, slaughtered the entire herd of pigs, and seized this mountain territory, surviving by preying on humans. Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered you, Bodhisattva—please, I beg you, save me! Tassa asked, “What is the name of this mountain?” The monster replied, “It’s called Mount Fuleng. Within the mountain lies a cave known as Yunzhan Cave. Originally, there lived a woman named Egg Sister Two inside that cave. Seeing that I had some martial skills, she made me the head of the household and even nicknamed me ‘Inverted Gate.’ But less than a year later, she died, leaving all her possessions to me. Now, after living here for so long, I have no meaningful occupation.” The Bodhisattva said, “As the ancients taught: ‘If you wish for a future, avoid actions that lead to none.’ You broke the laws of Heaven above, yet still refuse to abandon your violent nature, harming living beings and creating karma. Isn’t that committing two offenses at once?” The monster retorted, “A future? A future! If I followed your advice, I’d be left to starve! As the saying goes: ‘Obeying official law means being beaten to death; obeying Buddhist law means starving to death.’ Go away! Go away! It’s better to catch a traveler and feast on his fatty flesh! Who cares about two sins, three sins, a thousand sins, ten thousand sins!” The Bodhisattva replied, “‘Heaven responds to sincere human wishes.’ If you’re willing to turn to the righteous path, there will surely be a place for you to sustain yourself. The world has five grains; they can all satisfy hunger—why must you survive by eating people?” Upon hearing this, the monster seemed to awaken from a dream and said to the Bodhisattva, “I want to follow the right path, but how can I when ‘to offend Heaven leaves no prayer unanswered’?” The Bodhisattva continued, “I’ve received Buddha’s command to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. You could become his disciple and accompany him on a journey westward, redeeming your sins through merit, and I’ll ensure you escape this calamity.” The monster eagerly agreed, exclaiming, “I’m willing! I’m willing!” The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred upon him the precepts, assigned him the surname Zhu (Pig), gave him the Dharma name Zhu Wuneng, and instructed him to observe vegetarian vows, renouncing the five pungent vegetables and the three forbidden meats, patiently awaiting the arrival of the pilgrim. After parting ways with Mutza, the Bodhisattva and Mutza rose into the clouds, traveling onward, when suddenly they saw a jade dragon crying out in mid-air. Approaching it, the Bodhisattva asked, “Who are you, dragon, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon replied, “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I set fire to the luminous pearl in the palace, my father reported me to Heaven, accusing me of rebellion. The Five Emperors hung me in mid-air and beat me three hundred times, and soon I’ll be executed. Please, Bodhisattva, save me!” Hearing this, Guanyin immediately rushed with Mutza toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. There, the two celestial masters, Qiu and Zhang, greeted them and asked, “Where are you headed?” The Bodhisattva replied, “This humble monk wishes to see the Jade Emperor.” The two masters quickly reported the request, and the Jade Emperor descended from his throne to welcome them. After paying respects, the Bodhisattva said, “I’ve been sent by Buddha to seek the pilgrim in the Eastern Lands. On my way, I encountered a wicked dragon hanging here, and I’ve come specifically to petition for mercy, asking that his life be spared and entrusted to me, so he may serve as a mount for the pilgrim.” Upon hearing this, the Five Emperors immediately issued an edict of pardon, ordering a heavenly general to release the dragon and deliver him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva expressed gratitude and departed. The little dragon prostrated himself, thanking the Bodhisattva for saving his life, and pledged obedience to her commands. The Bodhisattva placed him deep in a ravine, where he would wait for the pilgrim to arrive, transforming into a white horse and earning merit in the West. The little dragon accepted the order and quietly disappeared. Leading Mutza, the Bodhisattva continued her journey across this mountain and onward toward the Eastern Lands. Not long after, they suddenly saw countless golden rays of light and auspicious vapors rising in thousands of streams. Mutza exclaimed, “Master, that shining place must be the Five Elements Mountain, where the Buddha’s ‘seal’ is affixed!” The Bodhisattva confirmed, “Indeed, that’s the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who once disrupted the Peach Banquet and caused chaos in the Heavenly Palace—he now lies imprisoned beneath this seal.” Mutza agreed, “Exactly, exactly!” Master and disciple climbed the mountain together and gazed upon the inscription, which read the six-syllable mantra: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” After examining it, the Bodhisattva sighed deeply and composed a poem, which reads:  \\\\\\\\nHow pitiful that the mischievous monkey defied authority,  \\\\\\\\nOnce reckless and bold, flaunting heroic might.  \\\\\\\\nDeceitful, he disrupted the Peach Banquet,  \\\\\\\\nDaringly intruded upon the Tuishou Palace.  \\\\\\\\nUnrivaled among ten thousand soldiers,  \\\\\\\\nHis might resounded through the nine heavens.  \\\\\\\\nNow trapped by our Buddha Shakyamuni,  \\\\\\\\nWhen will he stretch forth again and display his glory?  \\\\\\\\nWhile master and disciple were speaking, the Great Sage was already alerted.Da Sheng stood at the foot of the mountain and shouted loudly,  \\\\\\\\n“Who is it up there on the hill, reciting poetry and exposing my flaws?”  \\\\\\\\nUpon hearing this, the Bodhisattva immediately descended the mountain to investigate. Below the rocky cliff, they found the local deity, the mountain god, and the celestial generals who had been guarding the Great Sage—all coming forward to greet the Bodhisattva and escort them before the Great Sage himself. When they looked closely, they saw that he was trapped inside a stone casket, able to speak but unable to move. The Bodhisattva asked, “Hey you with the surname Sun, do you recognize me?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage opened his fiery golden eyes, nodded vigorously, and cried out, “How could I not know you? You are indeed the compassionate and merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo in the South Sea, who saves those in distress and hardship. Thank you for your kindness! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been spending each day here like an eternity, with not a single acquaintance to visit me. But pray tell, where have you come from?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “I was sent by the Buddha’s decree to journey eastward in search of someone to retrieve scriptures. Passing by here, I paused briefly to check on you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage said, “The Buddha deceived me, trapping me beneath this mountain for over five hundred years, unable to break free. I earnestly beg you, great Bodhisattva, to show me some mercy and rescue old Sun once and for all!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva responded, “Your sins run deep. If I were to free you now, I fear you’d only cause more trouble—such an outcome would hardly be commendable.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage insisted, “I’ve already repented deeply. Please, great compassionate one, point me toward a path of redemption, and I’ll willingly devote myself to cultivation.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so it came to pass:  \\\\\\\\n“A single thought arises in the human heart, and heaven and earth take note. If good and evil remain unpunished, surely heaven and earth must harbor bias.”  \\\\\\\\nHearing these words, the Bodhisattva felt immense joy and said to the Great Sage, “As the scriptures say: ‘Speak kindly, and distant lands will respond; speak unkindly, and distant lands will recoil.’ Since you’ve shown such sincerity, when I reach the Tang Empire in the East, I’ll find someone tasked with retrieving scriptures and instruct him to rescue you. You can become his disciple, uphold the teachings, and enter the Buddhist fold. Then we can work together toward enlightenment. What do you say?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage exclaimed loudly, “I accept! I accept!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva continued, “Since you’ve shown such virtue, let me give you a Dharma name.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage replied, “I already have a name—I’m called Sun Wukong.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva happily added, “Two others have previously taken refuge under the character ‘Wu’—you too shall bear that character, perfectly aligning with them. How wonderful, how wonderful! There’s no need for further reminders; I shall depart now.”  \\\\\\\\nThus, the Great Sage, having realized his true nature, returned wholeheartedly to Buddhism, while the Bodhisattva lingered, mindful of her divine mission.  \\\\\\\\nTogether with Mutzha, they set off eastward, arriving without delay in Chang’an, the capital of the Tang Empire. As mist cleared and clouds dispersed, master and disciple transformed into two ragged, leprous monks, entering the city of Chang’an unnoticed, unaware that evening had already fallen. Walking along the main market street, they spotted a local deity shrine and stepped right inside, startling the local deity and sending the ghostly soldiers into trembling fear. Realizing it was the Bodhisattva, the deity quickly prostrated himself in reverence. Hastily, the local deity ran to inform the City God, the district magistrate, and all the deities of every temple throughout Chang’an, who promptly gathered to pay their respects, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our tardiness in welcoming you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “You must not reveal this news. I’ve come here specifically by the Buddha’s command to seek out someone who will retrieve scriptures. I’ll temporarily stay in your temple for a few days, until I find the true monk, then I’ll return.”  \\\\\\\\nAll the deities returned to their respective posts, and the local deity was hurriedly relocated to the City God’s temple for temporary residence, while the master and disciple concealed their true forms.  \\\\\\\\nFor now, we don’t yet know whether they’ll succeed in finding the scripture seeker. Tune in next time to find out.  \\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Appendix: Chen Guangrui Sets Off for Office and Encounters Disaster; Jiangliu Monk Takes Revenge to Restore His Roots.  \\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of Chang’an, the great capital of Shaanxi Province, a city built as the imperial seat by emperors of past dynasties. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han eras, the three districts have blossomed like brocade, and eight rivers flow around the city, truly making it a land of scenic wonders. At this time, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Zhenguan, and had already reigned for thirteen years, in the year of Ji Si. The realm enjoyed peace, tribute flowed in from all directions, and the four seas acknowledged his sovereignty. One day, Emperor Taizong convened all civil and military officials, and after the morning ceremony concluded, Prime Minister Wei Zheng stepped forward and reported, “Today the realm is peaceful, and tranquility prevails in all directions. In accordance with ancient custom, we should open examination halls, recruit talented individuals, and promote capable people to serve in governance.”  \\\\\\\\nEmperor Taizong said,  \\\\\\\\n“What you propose, esteemed minister, is entirely reasonable.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so he issued a notice calling for talented scholars, proclaiming throughout the empire: all prefectures, provinces, and counties, regardless of whether they were military or civilian, anyone among the literati who possessed clear understanding of classical texts and excelled in the three examinations, should travel to Chang’an to take the test.When the imperial edict reached the region of Haizhou, a man named Chen Guangrui, with the courtesy name E, saw it and immediately returned home. He said to his mother, Lady Zhang, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The court has issued a yellow proclamation, calling for talented individuals from southern provinces to take the examinations. I intend to go and compete. If I can secure even a minor official post, it will bring honor and fame to my family, ensure prosperity for my wife and children, and bring glory to our household—this is my greatest ambition. I am informing you of my decision before I depart.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My son, as a scholar, you should indeed 'study in youth and act in adulthood.' That is exactly how it should be. But when you go to take the exams, you must be careful along the way, and once you obtain an official position, return home promptly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui then instructed his servants to pack his belongings, bid farewell to his mother, and set off on his journey without delay. Upon arriving in Chang'an, he found that the examination grounds were already open, so he entered the competition. After passing the preliminary tests and successfully completing the three policy essays in the imperial court examination, Emperor Tang personally bestowed upon him the title of zhuangyuan (top scholar) and awarded him a horse to ride through the streets for three days. Unexpectedly, during his parade, he passed by the residence of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, whose only daughter, Wen Jiao, also known as Mantang Jiao, had not yet married. She was standing atop a beautifully decorated pavilion, tossing a silk ball to select her husband. As Chen Guangrui happened to pass below, the young lady caught sight of his outstanding appearance and recognized him as the newly crowned zhuangyuan. Overjoyed, she threw down the silk ball, which landed squarely on Guangrui's black official cap. Suddenly, a gentle melody of flutes and strings filled the air, and more than ten maids descended from the pavilion, leading Guangrui's horse and escorting him into the prime minister's mansion to celebrate their wedding. The prime minister and his wife immediately came out to greet the guests, officiated the ceremony, and formally betrothed the young lady to Guangrui. They bowed to heaven and earth, exchanged vows as husband and wife, and paid respects to the bride's parents. The prime minister then ordered a banquet to be prepared, and they celebrated joyfully throughout the night.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two held hands tenderly as they entered the bridal chamber. The next morning, at the third watch of the day, Emperor Taizong took his seat in the Golden Hall, surrounded by civil and military officials who had gathered for court. Taizong asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What official position should be granted to the newly appointed zhuangyuan, Chen Guangrui?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Prime Minister Wei Zheng replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your servant has examined the available vacancies in various prefectures and counties and found that Jiangzhou currently has an unoccupied post. I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint him to this position.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Taizong immediately agreed and appointed Guangrui as governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to prepare for departure without delay. Guangrui expressed his gratitude, left the palace, returned to the prime minister's residence, discussed the matter with his wife, bid farewell to his in-laws, and set off with his wife toward Jiangzhou to assume his new post.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they left Chang'an, the weather was late spring, with gentle breezes turning the willows green and fine rain sprinkling red blossoms. Upon arriving home, Guangrui and his wife paid their respects to Lady Zhang. Lady Zhang said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Congratulations, my son! You've not only succeeded in the examinations but have also brought your bride home.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is entirely due to your blessings, Mother, that I was fortunate enough to become zhuangyuan, received the imperial procession through the streets, and encountered the silk ball toss in front of Prime Minister Yin's residence, where I was chosen as his daughter's husband. Now the court has appointed me governor of Jiangzhou, and I have come to fetch you so we may all travel together to take up my post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang was overjoyed and began preparing for the journey. After several days on the road, they arrived at Liu Xiao'er's inn near Wanhuadian. Suddenly, Lady Zhang fell ill, and she said to Guangrui, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm feeling unwell. Let's rest here for two days to recover before continuing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui obeyed her wishes. The following morning, he noticed a man selling a golden carp outside the inn. Guangrui bought it for one guan, intending to cook it for his mother. But as he looked closer, he saw that the fish blinked its eyes mysteriously. Astonished, Guangrui exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've heard that fish and snakes blink their eyes—it surely can't be an ordinary creature!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He then asked the fisherman, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Where did you catch this fish?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Fifteen li from the city, in the Hongjiang River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui immediately released the fish back into the river. Returning to the inn, he told his mother about it, and she said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Releasing living creatures is a virtuous deed, and I'm very pleased.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui added, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We've already stayed here for three days, and time is pressing. I plan to leave tomorrow, but I wonder if you're well enough to travel?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not feeling well, and the heat along the road might worsen my condition. Why don't you rent a house here temporarily while I stay behind? Leave some money with me, and you two can go ahead to take up your post. I'll join you when the autumn coolness arrives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui consulted with his wife, rented a house, gave his mother some funds, and bid them both farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe journey was arduous, with days of travel and nights spent in lodging, and soon they reached the Hongjiang ferry crossing. There, they found Liu Hong and Li Biao waiting to guide them across the river. It seemed that Guangrui's past karma had destined him to encounter these ill-fated individuals.Guangrui ordered his servant to carry their luggage aboard the boat. As husband and wife were about to board together, Liu Hong opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin: her face was as bright as the full moon, her eyes like autumn waters, her lips cherry-red, and her waist slender as a willow branch—indeed possessing beauty enough to make fish sink and wild geese fall from the sky, a countenance so dazzling it could shame the moon and blush flowers. Instantly consumed by wolfish intent, he conspired with Li Biao, steering the boat to an uninhabited stretch of water. When midnight struck, they first killed the servant, then beat Guangrui to death, dumping both bodies into the river. Seeing her husband slain, the young lady prepared to throw herself into the water as well. But Liu Hong grabbed her tightly, saying, “If you yield to me, all will be forgiven! If not, I’ll cut you down right here!” With no other choice, the lady reluctantly agreed, submitting to Liu Hong for the time being. The villain then rowed the boat to the southern shore, handing it over to Li Biao to manage, while he himself donned Guangrui’s attire and official credentials, taking the lady with him to assume his post in Jiangzhou.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the body of the murdered servant drifted downstream with the current, but Guangrui’s corpse sank to the bottom and remained motionless. A sea demon patrolling near the mouth of the Hong River happened to notice it and immediately reported to the Dragon King’s palace. At that very moment, the Dragon King was presiding over court when the demon reported: “Today, near the mouth of the Hong River, someone unknown has beaten to death a scholar and left his body at the bottom of the water.” The Dragon King ordered the body to be brought forth and examined closely. Upon inspection, he declared, “This man is none other than my savior! How could he have been murdered? As the saying goes, one repays kindness with kindness. Today, I must save his life to repay the favor he once showed me.” He immediately penned an official decree and dispatched the demon straight to the City God and Land Deity of Hongzhou, instructing them to retrieve the scholar’s soul and restore his life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe City God and Land Deity summoned a little ghost to deliver Chen Guangrui’s soul to the demon, who carried it to the Crystal Palace and presented it to the Dragon King. The Dragon King asked, “Young scholar, what is your name and family name? Where are you from? Why did you come here, only to be murdered?” Guangrui bowed respectfully and replied, “I am Chen E, courtesy name Guangrui, from Hongnong County, Haizhou. I was fortunate enough to become the top scholar in the recent imperial examinations and appointed governor of Jiangzhou. On my way to take up my post with my wife, we boarded a boat by the riverbank, only to be betrayed by the villain Liu Hong, who coveted my wife and murdered me, casting my body into the water. Great King, please save me!” Hearing this, the Dragon King said, “So it is! Sir, the golden carp you released earlier was none other than myself. You saved my life, and now that you’re in trouble, how could I possibly refuse to help?” He then had Guangrui’s body placed aside, inserting a magical bead into his mouth to preserve it intact, so that one day it could regain its spirit and seek vengeance. He added, “For now, your true soul shall temporarily serve as a chief official in my underwater realm.” Guangrui bowed deeply in gratitude, and the Dragon King hosted a banquet in his honor, which need not be detailed further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin loathed Liu the villain with every fiber of her being, wishing she could devour his flesh and flay his skin—but pregnant as she was, unsure whether the child was a boy or girl, she had no choice but to endure and comply for the time being. Before she knew it, they had arrived in Jiangzhou. Officials, clerks, and servants all came out to greet them. Local dignitaries arranged a grand banquet in the courthouse to celebrate. Liu Hong said, “My arrival here today is entirely due to your generous support.” The officials replied, “Your Excellency is highly talented and virtuous; naturally, you treat the people as your own children, keeping lawsuits simple and punishments light. We, your subordinates, are fortunate indeed—why be so modest?” After the banquet concluded, everyone dispersed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTime passed swiftly. One day, Liu Hong had urgent business far away, leaving the lady alone in the official residence, longing for her mother-in-law and husband. Sitting in the flower pavilion, she sighed deeply, suddenly feeling weary, with pain in her abdomen, and fainting to the ground. Unbeknownst to her, she gave birth to a son. Suddenly, a voice whispered in her ear: “Beloved daughter-in-law, heed my words carefully. I am the Star Lord of the South Pole, sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva’s command specifically to entrust this child to you. In the future, he will achieve great fame and distinction, far beyond the ordinary. When Liu the villain returns, he will surely harm this child, so you must protect him diligently. Your husband has already been rescued by the Dragon King; someday, husband and wife will reunite, mother and son will be reunited, and justice will finally be served. Remember my words well—wake up, wake up!” Having spoken these words, the voice vanished. The lady awoke, recalling every word clearly, clutching her child tightly, yet feeling utterly helpless. Suddenly, Liu Hong returned and, upon seeing the child, immediately tried to drown him. The lady quickly said, “It’s already late today; let’s wait until tomorrow to throw him into the river.” Fortunately, early the next morning, Liu Hong received urgent orders to leave on another distant errand. Secretly, the lady thought, “If we wait until the villain returns, this child’s life will be lost! Better to abandon him in the river now and let fate decide his destiny.”\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If Heaven takes pity on us and someone rescues this child, raising him as their own, perhaps we shall meet again someday.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But fearing it might be difficult to recognize him later, she bit her finger until it bled, writing a blood letter detailing her parents' names, origins, and the full story of their plight. She then bit off the little toe from the child's left foot, using it as a distinctive mark. Taking a close-fitting undershirt, she wrapped the baby in it and, seizing an opportune moment, carried him out of the official residence. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, so the young lady hurried to the riverside and burst into tears. Just as she was about to abandon the child, she suddenly noticed a wooden plank drifting lazily along the riverbank. Bowing toward the heavens in prayer, she carefully placed the baby onto the plank, secured him with a strap, tied the blood letter to his chest, and gently pushed the makeshift raft into the river, letting fate guide its course. With tears streaming down her face, she returned to the residence without further ado.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the child floated downstream on the wooden plank, drifting steadily until he came to rest at the foot of Jinshan Temple. The abbot of Jinshan Temple was a venerable monk named Faming, who had attained profound enlightenment through spiritual cultivation and mastered the subtle secrets of immortality. While meditating in deep contemplation, he suddenly heard the cries of a baby. His heart stirred, and he hurried to the riverside, where he saw a tiny infant sleeping peacefully on a piece of driftwood. Hastily, he rescued the child and, upon examining the blood letter clutched in the baby's hand, learned of his origins. He gave the child a nickname, Jiangliu, entrusted him to others for care, and carefully preserved the blood letter as a precious keepsake. Time flew by like an arrow, days and months passing swiftly, and before anyone realized it, Jiangliu had grown into an eighteen-year-old youth. The abbot then called him forward, shaved his head, and ordained him as a monk, giving him the Dharma name Xuanzang. After receiving the precepts and having his head touched, Xuanzang resolved firmly to pursue the path of enlightenment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, during the late spring season, everyone gathered beneath the shade of pine trees to listen to sutras, engage in meditation, and discuss profound teachings. At that very moment, a dissolute monk who indulged in meat and wine found himself utterly confounded by Xuanzang. Enraged, the monk lashed out, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You wretched creature! You don't even know your own name or your parents—what right do you have to meddle here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Hearing such harsh words, Xuanzang knelt before his master in the temple, tears streaming down his face, and pleaded earnestly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"All beings are born between heaven and earth, nourished by yin and yang and sustained by the five elements. It is only natural that one is born of a father and raised by a mother. How can there be a person in this world without parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He continued to implore his master repeatedly, begging to learn the names of his parents. The abbot finally said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you truly wish to find your parents, come with me to my quarters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang followed him to the abbot's chamber, where the elder climbed up to the rafters, retrieved a small box, and opened it to reveal the blood letter and the undershirt, handing them over to Xuanzang. As Xuanzang unfolded the blood letter and read it carefully, he finally learned the full details of his parents' names and the tragic circumstances surrounding their wrongful deaths. Upon finishing the reading, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How can I call myself human if I cannot avenge my parents' wrongs? For eighteen years, I've lived without knowing my birth parents, and only today do I discover that I have a mother. Had it not been for my master rescuing and nurturing me, how could I stand here today? Please allow me to go seek out my mother, and afterward, I will carry incense bowls on my head, rebuild the temple, and repay my master's immense kindness!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you wish to find your mother, take this blood letter and undershirt with you. Simply beg alms as you travel directly to the private residence in Jiangzhou, and there you shall surely meet your mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang accepted his master's instructions, disguised himself as a mendicant monk, and set off straight for Jiangzhou. Coincidentally, Liu Hong happened to be away on business, and fate seemed to bring mother and son together. Xuanzang arrived at the gate of the private residence, chanting sutras and calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Yin, meanwhile, had dreamt the previous night of a waning moon that had fully regained its roundness. She mused to herself, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother-in-law remains missing, my husband was murdered by bandits, and my son was cast into the river. If someone has adopted him, he must now be eighteen years old. Perhaps today, heaven has arranged for us to meet again—it cannot be mere coincidence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As she pondered these thoughts, she suddenly heard someone chanting sutras outside the residence, calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Seizing the opportunity, she stepped out and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"From where do you come?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am a humble monk, a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"So you are indeed a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple—\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and invited him inside, offering him a meal. As she observed his demeanor and speech closely, she noticed a striking resemblance to her late husband. She dismissed her maidservants and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Young master, did you become a monk from childhood, or did you enter the monastic life later in life? What is your full name, and do you still have living parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I did not become a monk in childhood, nor did I enter the priesthood in middle age. To tell you the truth, my grievances are as vast as the sky, and my hatred runs as deep as the sea! My father was treacherously murdered, and my mother was taken by bandits. My master, Abbot Faming, instructed me to come to the Jiangzhou residence and search for my mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is your mother's surname?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother's surname is Yin, her given name is Wenjiao; my father's surname is Chen, his given name is Guangrui; my childhood nickname was Jiangliu, and my Dharma name is Xuanzang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wenjiao—that is me! But what proof do you have to support your claim?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing that it was his mother, Xuanzang dropped to his knees and burst into tears: “If my mother doesn’t believe me, here’s proof—a blood-written undershirt!” Wenjiao took the undershirt and examined it carefully; sure enough, it was genuine. Mother and son embraced each other, weeping bitterly, and she urged him, “My son, hurry and leave at once!” Xuanzang replied, “For eighteen years I’ve never known my birth parents, and only today have I finally met my mother—how can I bear to part from her?” The young lady said, “My son, you must quickly make your escape! If Liu the bandit returns, he’ll surely take your life! Tomorrow I’ll pretend to fall ill, claiming that years ago I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk’s shoes, and I’ll come to your temple to fulfill that vow. At that time, I’ll have something important to tell you.” Xuanzang, following her advice, bowed farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, ever since seeing her son, the young lady had been filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry. One day, she suddenly feigned illness, refusing food and drink, and lay down in bed. When Liu Hong returned to the office and asked about the reason, she said, “When I was young, I made a vow to donate one hundred pairs of monk’s shoes. Five days ago, I dreamt of a monk holding a sharp blade, demanding those shoes, and ever since then I’ve felt unwell.” Liu Hong exclaimed, “Why didn’t you mention such a trivial matter earlier?” He immediately ordered Wang Zuo Ya and Li You Ya to convene in court: all households in Jiangzhou city were instructed to prepare one pair of monk’s shoes each, with a deadline of five days for completion. The people dutifully fulfilled the order. Then the young lady turned to Liu Hong and asked, “Now that the monk’s shoes are ready, which temple would be suitable for me to go and fulfill my vow?” Liu Hong replied, “In Jiangzhou there’s Jinshan Temple and Jiaoshan Temple—whichever temple you prefer, you may choose.” The young lady said, “I’ve long heard that Jinshan Temple is an excellent monastery, so I shall go there.” Liu Hong immediately summoned Wang and Li, ordering them to prepare a boat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady brought along her trusted attendants, boarded the boat, and as soon as the oars pushed off, they headed straight for Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, back at the temple, Xuanzang reported everything to Elder Faming, who was overjoyed upon hearing the tale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, a maid arrived first, announcing that the lady had come to the temple to fulfill her vow. All the monks came out to greet her.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady walked directly through the temple gates, paid homage to the Bodhisattva, and arranged a grand vegetarian feast. She then instructed her maids to place the monk’s shoes and socks on a tray. When she reached the main hall, she again lit incense and offered prayers, after which she asked Elder Faming to distribute the offerings among the monks. Once the monks had dispersed and the hall was empty, Xuanzang knelt forward. The young lady asked him to remove his shoes and socks, and indeed, a small toe was missing from his left foot. At that moment, the two embraced once more, weeping uncontrollably, and expressed their gratitude to the elder for raising him. Faming said, “Now that mother and son have reunited, there’s a risk that the villain might find out. You must quickly withdraw before disaster strikes.” The young lady added, “My son, I’m giving you this ring as a token. Head northwest toward Hongzhou, a journey of roughly fifteen hundred li. There, in Wanhuadian, you’ll find Granny Zhang, your father’s own mother. I’ve also written you a letter to deliver to the imperial palace in Tang’s capital, to the home of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, on the left side of the Golden Hall—those are your maternal grandparents. Hand my letter to your grandfather, and ask him to petition the Tang emperor, gather troops, capture this villain, avenge your father, and only then will your mother’s life be saved. I dare not linger here any longer, for fear that the villain might suspect me if I return late.” With that, she left the temple, boarded the boat, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang returned to the temple, weeping, and informed his master before bidding farewell immediately, heading straight for Hongzhou. Upon arriving at Wanhuadian, he asked the shopkeeper, Liu Xia’er, “Years ago, a guest named Chen from Jiangzhou stayed at your inn with his mother. How is she doing now?” Liu Xia’er replied, “She did stay at my inn, but later her eyesight failed, and for three or four years she didn’t pay me rent. Now she lives in a dilapidated kiln near the South Gate, begging daily on the streets to survive. That guest left long ago, and since then we’ve had no news of him whatsoever—no one knows why.” Upon hearing this, Xuanzang immediately went to the South Gate and found the old woman living in the broken kiln. The old woman exclaimed, “Your voice sounds just like my son, Chen Guangrui!” Xuanzang replied, “I’m not Chen Guangrui—I’m his son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother.” The old woman asked, “Why haven’t your parents come?” Xuanzang answered, “My father was beaten to death by bandits, and my mother was taken by force as their wife.” The old woman continued, “How did you know to come looking for me?” Xuanzang explained, “My mother sent me to find you. She gave me a letter and a ring.” The old woman took the letter and the ring, bursting into tears as she cried out, “My son came all this way for fame and success—I thought he’d betrayed us and forgotten his kindness, never imagining he’d been murdered!”And I am glad that the emperor has pity on me. After my son, today there are grandchildren looking for me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are your mother-in-law's eyes faint?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I cried so hard that my eyes fainted because I thought about your father all day long and I didn't see him coming.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the Sky: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and his parents' hatred cannot be avenged. Today, I took my mother's order to find my mother-in-law. If the sky shows my disciple's sincerity, I will keep my mother-in-law's eyes clear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After wishing, he licked the tip of his tongue and his mother-in-law's eyes. In a moment, my eyes lick open and still return to the same place. The mother-in-law looked at the young monk and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You are my grandson! It's just like my son Guang Rui!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law was happy and sad. Xuanzang took her mother-in-law out of the kiln door, went to Liu Xiaoer's shop, and put some money in a house to live with her mother-in-law. Then she entangled herself with her mother-in-law and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'll be back in less than a month.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Then he quit his mother-in-law and headed for the capital. He found Prime Minister Yin's Mansion on Huangcheng East Street and said to the door, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The little monk is a relative. Come to visit Xianggong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The door was informed of the prime minister, who said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have no relatives with the monk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The wife said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I dreamed last night that my daughter came home full of charming, unless my son-in-law came back with letters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister then taught the young monk to come to the hall. When the young monk saw the Prime Minister and his wife, he cried and bowed to the ground. He took out a book from his arms and handed it to the prime minister. The Prime Minister opened it, read it from the beginning, and cried bitterly. The lady asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What was the accident?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This Monk is my nephew and yours. Son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by thieves, and Mantang Jiao was forcibly taken as his wife by thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Madame listened and cried bitterly. The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Madam is worried. Come to the court to tell the Lord and personally command the troops. You must avenge your son-in-law.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The next day, the prime minister entered the dynasty and inspired the Tang King to say: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Today, Chen Guangrui, the top scholar of his son-in-law, led his family Xiaojiang to take office. He was killed by Liu Hong, a little water, and took his daughter as his wife. He pretended to be a son-in-law and became an official for many years. This is a change. His Majesty beggars immediately sent troops to eliminate thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" When the King of the Tang Dynasty saw that he was furious, he sent 60,000 Imperial troops to the Prime Minister Yin to supervise the soldiers. The Prime Minister led the decree out of the court, that is, he ordered soldiers to the teaching ground and headed for Jiangzhou. Xiao Xing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, but he did not realize he had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's soldiers and horses all went down to camp on the north bank. Starry night ordered the gold medal to be called to Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state sentenced two people. The Prime Minister told him that he knew about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before the sky was clear, Liu Hong's Yamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the Golden Drums were ringing, and the soldiers killed into the private office. Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured early. The Prime Minister handed down a military order to tie Liu Hong and his men to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister went straight into the main hall of the government office and sat down. Please ask the young lady to come out and meet. If the young lady wants to stay and go out, she will hang herself if she is ashamed of her father. Hearing this, Xuanzang hurriedly rescued his mother, knelt down on his knees and said to his mother, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Son and grandfather, unify the troops here and avenge your father. Today, the thief has been captured. Why did my mother want to die? If the mother dies, how can the child survive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister also went to the government to persuade him. The young lady said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I heard that the woman died from one thing. Tongfu has been killed by thieves, how can he be ashamed of being a thief? Because of the posthumous body, had to endure shame to steal life. Today, Xing'er has grown up and seen his old father take revenge for his daughter. What will he see! Only death can repay her husband's ear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is not my son's change of course with ups and downs. It is all because of a last resort. Why should I be ashamed!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Father and son hugged and cried, and Xuanzang also mourned. The Prime Minister wiped away his tears and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You two should stop worrying. I have captured the enemy thief now, and I will send it off.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That is, I got up and went to the Dharma Field. It happened that Jiangzhou Tongzhi also sent sentinels to take the water thief Li Biao.The prime minister was overjoyed and immediately ordered the soldiers to bring Liu Hong and Li Biao forward. Each was flogged severely with one hundred strokes, after which they confessed under duress, admitting their conspiracy years ago to murder Chen Guangrui. First, Li Biao was nailed onto a wooden donkey, dragged to the marketplace, and executed by being sliced into a thousand pieces, his head then displayed publicly as a warning. Next, Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang ferry crossing, the very spot where he had killed Chen Guangrui years ago. The prime minister, accompanied by the young lady and Xuanzang, personally went to the riverside, offering prayers toward the heavens. They then cruelly gouged out Liu Hong's heart and liver, using them as offerings for Guangrui, and burned a memorial text as part of the ritual.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe three stood by the river weeping bitterly, an act that soon alarmed the underwater realm. A sea patrol Yaksha quickly presented the memorial text to the Dragon King. After reading it, the Dragon King dispatched General Bie Wu to summon Guangrui. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sir,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said the Dragon King, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"congratulations! Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all at the riverside paying tribute to you. I shall now restore your soul. Moreover, I offer you one如意珠, two walking beads, ten lengths of fine silk, and a beaded jade belt. Today, you shall finally reunite with your wife, child, and mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui bowed repeatedly in gratitude. The Dragon King then instructed the Yaksha to carry Guangrui's body out of the river mouth and restore his soul. The Yaksha accepted the order and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin had finished mourning her husband and was about to throw herself into the water to end her life, but Xuanzang desperately grabbed hold of her, preventing her from doing so. In the midst of this chaos, suddenly a corpse floated up on the water's surface, drifting close to the riverbank. Miss Yin hurried forward to examine it and recognized her husband's body, bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone gathered around to watch, and they saw Guangrui slowly stretching his fists and legs, his body gradually coming back to life. Suddenly, he sat up, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Guangrui opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin, his father-in-law Prime Minister Yin, and the little monk all weeping beside him. Guangrui asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are you all here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Miss Yin replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Because you were murdered by bandits, and later I gave birth to our son. Fortunately, he was raised by the abbot of Jinshan Temple and eventually found me. I sent him to seek out your father, who learned of your fate and petitioned the court. He led troops here, captured the bandits, and just now, they took your heart and liver as offerings to you. I never imagined you would come back to life!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui explained, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's all because years ago, when we were at the Wanhuadeng shop, I bought and released that golden carp. Little did I know that carp was actually the Dragon King of these waters. When the villain pushed me into the river, it was thanks to him that I survived. Now he has restored my soul and bestowed upon me these treasures. And I never expected you to give birth to our son, nor that my father-in-law would avenge me. Truly, after enduring so much hardship, sweet happiness has finally arrived—a joy beyond measure!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpon hearing the news, all the officials came to congratulate them. The prime minister ordered a banquet to be prepared, thanking his subordinates before the army began its return journey. Arriving at Wanhuadeng, the prime minister ordered the troops to set up camp. Guangrui, accompanied by Xuanzang, went to Liu's shop to find his mother-in-law. That night, she had a dream: a withered tree blossomed, and magpies chirped incessantly behind her house. She thought, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Could it be my grandson returning?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Before she could finish her thoughts, Guangrui and his son appeared at the door. The little monk pointed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that my grandmother?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Upon seeing his aged mother, Guangrui immediately knelt down and prostrated himself. Mother and son embraced, weeping bitterly, and recounted everything that had happened. After settling the bill at the inn, they set off for the capital. Upon entering the prime minister's residence, Guangrui, Miss Yin, his mother, and Xuanzang all met the lady of the house. Overjoyed, she ordered her servants to prepare a grand feast in celebration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe prime minister declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us call today's banquet the Reunion Feast.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It truly was a joyful family gathering.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next morning, Emperor Tang ascended the throne, and Prime Minister Yin stepped forward to report in detail all that had transpired, recommending Guangrui for high office. The emperor approved the recommendation and immediately appointed Chen E as a scholar, entrusting him with state affairs. Xuanzang resolved to devote himself to Zen meditation and was sent to practice at Hongfu Temple. Later, Miss Yin calmly took her own life, and Xuanzang returned to Jinshan Temple to express gratitude to Abbot Faming. As for what happened afterward, we shall leave that for the next installment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Chapter Nine: Yuan Shoucheng's Brilliant Calculation, Free from Selfish Intentions; the Old Dragon King's Foolish Scheme Violates Heavenly Law\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPoem:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA great city in the capital, truly worth beholding,\\\\\\\\nEight rivers flow around the four mountains.\\\\\\\\nHow many emperors rose from this place;\\\\\\\\nSince ancient times, the world speaks of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis chapter specifically describes the great city of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, the site where emperors of successive dynasties established their capitals. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, the land has been adorned with colorful flowers, and eight rivers flow around the city. Thirty-six flower-lined alleys and seventy-two music pavilions stand proudly.According to the map of Hua and Yi, the world’s foremost region truly is a land of extraordinary beauty. Now, Emperor Taizong Wen of the Tang Dynasty has ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Longji Zhenguan. It has already been thirteen years since his coronation, and the current year is Ji Si. Not to mention the heroic figures who stand before him, safeguarding the realm and stabilizing the country, nor those outstanding talents who fought bravely to expand its borders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of two virtuous men living by the Jing River outside Chang’an city: one is a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other a woodcutter named Li Ding. Both are scholars who failed the imperial examinations but are literate mountain folk. One day, after selling their firewood in Chang’an and trading the carp from their baskets, they entered an inn together, enjoyed themselves until half-drunk, each carrying a bottle, and slowly strolled back along the banks of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Brother Li, I think those who strive for fame end up sacrificing their bodies for it; those who chase profit lose themselves in pursuit of gain; those who accept titles sleep with tigers by their side; and those who bask in favor carry snakes up their sleeves. When you come down to it, we’re better off enjoying our serene waters and verdant mountains, living freely and carefree, content with simplicity, letting fate guide us.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding replied, “Brother Zhang, you make a valid point. But your beautiful waters aren’t as good as my lush mountains.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nZhang Shao retorted, “Your lush mountains aren’t as fine as my beautiful waters.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo prove his point, he quoted a poem titled “Die Lian Hua”:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“On misty waters stretching ten thousand li, a tiny boat drifts alone, quietly moored beneath a lone awning, the voice of Xi Shi lingers round about. Free from worldly cares, cleansed of greed and fame, I leisurely pluck reeds and smartweeds by the willow-lined shore. A few sand terns delight my eyes, in willow groves and reed bays, my wife and children laugh with joy. After a peaceful sleep, the winds and waves seem playful—no honor, no disgrace, no worries at all.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding countered, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Die Lian Hua’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In a stretch of cloud-covered woods, pines bloom profusely; silently I listen to the warbling birds, their tongues as skillful as flutes. The red fades, the green grows rich—the spring is warm, yet summer swiftly arrives. Then autumn comes easily, changing everything; golden flowers bloom, perfect for admiring. And soon winter arrives sharp as a finger snap, yet I roam free through all four seasons, unbothered by anyone.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman said, “Your lush mountains can’t compare to my beautiful waters. Let me share a ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to illustrate how much better off we are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In the fairyland of clouds and water, life is complete; a boat with oars laid across is my home. Fresh scales I slice, green turtles I cook; purple crabs steamed, red shrimp boiled. Green bamboo shoots, water plantain sprouts—water caltrops and lotus roots are even more delightful. Tender lotus roots, aged lotus seeds, tender celery leaves—water chestnuts, water bamboo, and bird’s-eye flowers.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter replied, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to show how much better we have it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Towering peaks reach toward the horizon, a thatched hut is my home. Cured chicken, goose, crab, and turtle—wild boar, roe deer, hare, and deer surpass fish and shrimp. Chinese toon leaves, yellow catalpa buds—bamboo shoots and mountain tea are even more splendid. Purple plums, red peaches, ripe apricots and plums, sweet pears, sour jujubes, osmanthus blossoms.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman insisted, “Your lush mountains really can’t compete with my beautiful waters. Here’s another ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A little boat drifts wherever it may, amid countless layers of misty waves, fearless and free. Casting hooks and nets, I catch fresh fish, not greasy or oily, yet delicious beyond compare; old wife and young child gather round for reunion. With plenty of fish, I head to Chang’an market, trade for fine wine, and drink myself into a stupor. My raincoat serves as blanket on the autumn river, snoring peacefully, without a care, unattached to worldly honors or riches.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter retorted, “Brother Zhang, your beautiful waters still can’t match the joy of my mountain life. Here’s a ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A few thatched huts built beneath the hills, pines, bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids—how lovely they are! Through forests and over ridges, I search for dry firewood, no one scolds me, I sell as I please, more or less depending on the world. With the money earned, I buy wine and drink at will, savoring freedom in earthenware bowls and porcelain cups. Drunken and drowsy, I lie beneath the pines, unburdened, unconcerned, indifferent to rise or fall in this mortal world.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman concluded, “Brother Li, your mountain life can’t match the joy of my riverside business. Here’s a ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“The red smartweed blooms profusely under moonlight, yellow reeds sway wildly in the breeze. The azure sky stretches far, the Chu River flows empty and clear, stirring the reflections of stars in the pond. Big fish swim in schools into the net, small mandarin fish cluster around the hook. Once caught, they taste especially rich when cooked—laughing and joking, I roam the rivers and lakes.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter responded, “Brother Zhang, your riverside life still can’t match the joy of my mountain business. Here’s another ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Withered leaves and dead vines fill the paths, broken branches and old bamboo cover the hills. Wild vines and dried kudzu twine wildly, I gather them, tie them up, and carry them off. Worm-eaten hollow elm and willow, wind-broken pine and nanmu trees—\\\\\\\\nI collect them, pile them up for winter’s cold, and trade them for wine and money.”The fisherman said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Though your mountain may be comparable, it still can't match the serene elegance of my waters. Here's a poem to prove it: As the tide ebbs, a lone boat drifts away; at night's deep hour, the oarsman's song fades off. Under the crescent moon, my raincoat brings such quiet charm—wakeful gulls startled, yet unable to rise; colorful clouds part in the sky. Lying idly on the reed isle, with nothing to do, I linger until the sun climbs three poles high. Following my heart's desire, I arrange my days as I please; while courtiers shiver waiting for the watchman's call, how could they compare to my carefree spirit?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your waters' tranquil grace cannot rival the deeper serenity of my green mountains, and here's another poem to attest: On autumn paths, I stride forth with axe in hand; in evening coolness, I return bearing my load. Wildflowers tucked into my hair bring even greater wonder—parting clouds, I find my way; waiting for the moon, I knock at the gate. My young son and mountain wife greet me with joyful smiles; on a bed of grass and wooden pillow, I stretch and rest. Steaming pears and cooking millet, I quickly prepare; new brew matures in jars—truly, this deepens my tranquil heart!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman continued, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These are merely our trades, our means of sustenance. You lack the joys I find in leisure time, as this poem shows: Leisurely watching white cranes fly across the sky, I moor my boat by the stream and close the green door. Leaning against the cabin, I teach my child to twist fishing lines, and after rowing, spread the nets out with my wife. With calm resolve, I truly sense the waves have stilled; at ease, I naturally feel the breeze grow mild. A green raincoat and bamboo hat I wear at will—far better than donning purple robes in court.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yet your leisure time still doesn't match mine, as this poem also proves: Leisurely watching wispy clouds drift by, I sit alone in my thatched hut, closing the bamboo door. Without tasks, I instruct my child to read from scrolls; sometimes, I gather friends to play chess. When joy comes, I lean on my staff and sing along fragrant paths; when inspiration strikes, I carry my zither up to verdant heights. Straw sandals, hemp ropes, coarse cloth for bedding—such contentment far surpasses fine silken robes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Li Ding, we truly can enjoy light verses together without needing drums or golden goblets. Let's exchange a few lines each, and see how well we fishermen and woodcutters converse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Li Ding replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Zhang speaks most wisely; please begin with a verse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My boat rests in emerald waters amid misty ripples, my home lies deep in mountains and wild fields. I especially love spring floods over stream bridges, and most cherish morning mists among rocky peaks. Fresh carp from Longmen often graced my pot, dry firewood charred under daily flames. Fishing nets provide various ways to support old age, carrying poles sustain me till the end. In my small boat, I lie back watching geese take flight, along grassy paths slanting, listening to cranes cry out. In the marketplace of words, I hold no stake; in seas of right and wrong, my trace grows faint. By the stream, cloths hang drying like brocade, on stones I sharpen axes sharp as blades. Under autumn moons, I often fish alone; in spring mountains, no one meets me in solitude. When fish abound, I trade them for wine to share with my wife; leftover firewood sells to buy more liquor for my children. Singing and sipping freely, I let loose and roam; long songs and sighs, I yield to winds that toss and turn. Calling brothers and shipmates, I invite fellow travelers; friends and companions gather with rustic folk. Drinking games and fist-clenching contests pass cups repeatedly; card games and wordplay fill the hours with laughter. Cooking shrimp and crabs brings daily delight, stir-frying duck and braising chicken makes every day rich. My simple wife brews tea with playful ease, my mountain wife cooks meals with calm assurance. At dawn, I raise my staff to stir gentle waves, at sunrise, I carry firewood over rushing streams. After rain, I don my raincoat to catch live carp; in wind, I wield my axe to fell dead pines. Hiding from the world, I feign foolishness and dullness, concealing my name and living mute and deaf.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Li, I took the liberty of starting first; now it's your turn—please begin a couplet, and I shall follow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A madman of mountains and wilds, pretending madness in wind and moonlight, an old man lingering proudly in rivers and lakes. Free time belongs to those who live carefree lives, free from gossip, rejoicing in peace. On moonlit nights, I sleep soundly in a thatched hut; in dusk, a light bamboo cloak shields my body. Lost in joy, I make friends with pine and plum, gladly pledge with gulls and egrets. No schemes for fame and fortune occupy my mind; no sounds of strife reach my ears. A sip of fragrant homemade wine at any hour, three meals of wild vegetable soup each day. Two bundles of firewood sustain my life, a fishing rod provides my livelihood. I casually call my child to sharpen steel axes, quietly summon my simple lad to mend old cloths. In spring, I love watching willows turn green, when seasons blend, I delight in reeds and rushes. In summer, I escape the heat by tending new bamboo shoots, in June, I cool off picking tender water caltrops. When frost descends, chickens grow plump and ready for slaughter, on Double Ninth Festival, crabs thrive and are cooked just in time. In winter, I still sleep late as the sun rises, through the Nine Cold Days, I stay warm without steaming. Through all eight seasons, I let my nature run free in the mountains; in four seasons, I indulge my heart by the lake. Gathering firewood brings the joy of immortals, fishing bears no mark of worldly ties. Outside my door, wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues; before my boat, green waters ripple smoothly. Content in my humble state, I need not speak of high office; my settled nature surpasses even a city ten miles wide.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“Ten miles of city walls, high defenses and strict orders; three high officials, their status renowned, listening to imperial edicts. To enjoy mountains and waters is truly rare—how grateful we are to Heaven, Earth, and the gods!” As they exchanged verses and linked their poetic lines, they reached the point where their paths diverged and bowed farewell to each other. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, take care on your journey! Be cautious when climbing the mountain, watch out for tigers. If any danger should arise, tomorrow’s street might see one less old friend!” Upon hearing this, Li Ding flew into a rage: “You lazy scoundrel! True friends share life and death together—how dare you curse me like that? If I meet with harm from a tiger, you’ll surely face the waves and be swept away by the river!” Zhang Shao replied, “I swear I’ll never be tossed about by rivers again.” Li Ding retorted, “Heaven holds unpredictable storms, and fate brings temporary fortune or misfortune. How can you guarantee you’ll remain unscathed?” Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, though you speak thus, you haven’t grasped the truth; my business, at least, offers some certainty—I’m certain I won’t encounter such trouble.” Li Ding asked, “Your livelihood on the water is extremely dangerous and perilous, shrouded in mystery and obscurity—what certainty can there be?” Zhang Shao replied, “You simply don’t understand. In Chang’an city, on West Gate Street, there’s a fortune-teller who sells divination. Every day I bring him a golden carp, and he secretly passes me a lesson, guiding me by direction, always hitting the mark. Today I went to buy another reading, and he instructed me to cast my net east of Jinghe Bay’s bend and set my line along the western bank—surely I’ll return with a boatload of fish and shrimp. Tomorrow I’ll come into the city, sell my catch, buy wine, and meet up with you again.” With these words, the two parted ways.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they spoke, someone was lurking in the grass. It turned out that a night demon patrolling the waters of the Jing River had overheard the talk about hitting the mark every time. He quickly rushed back to the Crystal Palace and urgently reported to the Dragon King:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Trouble! Trouble!” The Dragon King asked, “What kind of trouble?” The night demon replied, “While patrolling the riverbank, I heard two fishermen chatting. As they parted, their words were quite alarming. One fisherman said there’s a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an city who makes the most accurate predictions. Every day he gives him a carp, and the fortune-teller secretly teaches him how to hit the mark every single time. If his predictions prove true, won’t he end up wiping out all the aquatic creatures? How then can our underwater palace maintain its splendor, and how can we continue leaping through waves and assisting Your Majesty’s power?” The Dragon King was furious and immediately drew his sword, ready to march on Chang’an and destroy this fortune-teller. But just then, dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp ministers and crab officials, shad generals, mandarin fish lieutenants, and carp prime ministers stepped forward and jointly petitioned:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Your Majesty, please calm down. As the saying goes, words heard casually should not be taken at face value. If Your Majesty goes now, clouds will surely gather, rain will surely fall, and the people of Chang’an may be frightened, drawing blame from Heaven. Your Majesty’s presence is mysterious and unpredictable, capable of infinite transformations—but why not simply transform into a scholar and visit Chang’an yourself? If such a person exists, we can deal with him later; but if he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be unjust to harm others unnecessarily?” The Dragon King heeded their advice, laid down his sword, refrained from summoning clouds or rain, stepped ashore, and transformed himself into a scholar dressed in white, truly majestic and imposing, towering above the valleys and reaching toward the sky. His gait was dignified and proper, his conduct precise and upright. His speech followed Confucius and Mencius, his manners reflected the elegance of King Wen of Zhou. He wore a jade-colored robe and a leisurely headscarf with a single character embroidered on it. Setting off, he strode through the clouds and arrived directly on West Gate Street in Chang’an. There he saw a crowd gathered, bustling and noisy, filled with lively discussions: “Those born in the Year of the Dragon clash with those born in the Year of the Tiger. Though the combinations of Yin-Chen-Si-Hai are considered harmonious, what’s feared is the day clashing with the ruler of the year.” Hearing this, the Dragon King realized this must be the fortune-teller’s place. He stepped forward, pushed through the crowd, and peered inside. What he saw was a room adorned with pearls and jewels on all four walls, rich brocade and silk filling the hall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fragrance of precious incense never ceased, and the porcelain bottles held crystal-clear water. On either side hung paintings by Wang Wei, while above the seat hung an image of Guiguzi.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Duanxi inkstone, golden smoke ink, matched perfectly with a brush of frosty bristles; the Fire Pearl Forest and Guo Pu’s numerology stood beside the newly revised court texts. Six Lines mastered thoroughly, Eight Trigrams understood perfectly. Able to know heaven and earth, skilled at discerning spirits and gods. A compass arranged noon and midnight precisely, a belly full of stars clearly arrayed. Indeed, future events and past matters were as clear as moonlit mirrors; which families prospered and which declined, judged as clearly as divine insight. Foreseeing misfortune and determining good fortune, pronouncing death and proclaiming life. Speaking swiftly as wind and rain, writing so that ghosts and gods trembled. The sign read: “Divine Lessons, Master Yuan Shoucheng.” Who was this man? He turned out to be none other than Yuan Shoucheng, uncle of Yuan Tiangang, the current Imperial Astronomer and Chief of the Bureau of Astronomy.Indeed, the gentleman had an extraordinary appearance, graceful demeanor, and his fame spread throughout the land; his skills were unrivaled in Chang'an. The Dragon King entered and met with the gentleman. After exchanging formal greetings, he invited the Dragon to take a seat, and a young attendant presented tea. The gentleman then asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What brings you here today?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've come to consult you about the weather forecast for tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman immediately drew a divination chart from his sleeve and declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Clouds obscure the mountaintops, mist veils the treetops. If you're asking about rain, it will surely fall tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King pressed further, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At what exact time will it rain tomorrow? And how much rainfall can we expect?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tomorrow at Chen hour clouds will gather, at Si hour thunder will roll, at Wu hour rain will begin, and by Wei hour the rain will be sufficient, totaling three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This cannot be taken lightly! If it truly rains tomorrow according to your predicted timing and amount, I'll reward you with fifty taels of gold as a token of gratitude. But if it doesn't rain, or if the timing or amount is even slightly off, let me tell you plainly—I'll smash your facade, tear down your signboard, and drive you out of Chang'an immediately, never again allowed to deceive the people!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman cheerfully responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Very well, I accept your challenge. Please rest assured, the rain will certainly arrive tomorrow as predicted.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Dragon King took his leave, departed Chang'an, and returned to the Water Palace. The lesser water deities greeted him and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How was your visit to that fortune-teller?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh yes, indeed! What a smooth-talking fellow! I asked him when it would rain, and he confidently predicted tomorrow's rain. When I pressed him for specific times and amounts, he said clouds would form at Chen hour, thunder would strike at Si hour, rain would start at Wu hour, and by Wei hour the rainfall would reach three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points. So I made a wager with him: if his prediction comes true, I'll give him fifty taels of gold as a reward; but if there's even the slightest discrepancy, I'll destroy his facade, kick him out, and forbid him from ever deceiving people in Chang'an again!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The aquatic creatures all laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty is the Grand Master of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God in charge of rain—only you know whether it will rain or not. How dare he speak such nonsense? That fortune-teller is sure to lose! He's bound to lose!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the dragon princes, grandsons, and fish, carp, and crabs were still laughing and discussing this matter, they suddenly heard a voice echoing from mid-air: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial decree!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Everyone looked up and saw a golden-clad warrior holding an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, heading straight toward the Water Palace. Startled, the Dragon King quickly straightened his robes, lit incense, and respectfully received the decree.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the golden-clad warrior returned to the heavens, the Dragon King expressed his gratitude, opened the sealed document, and read aloud: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Imperial Edict to the General of the Eight Rivers, commanding thunder and lightning; tomorrow you shall bestow rain to benefit the city of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The edict precisely matched the timing and rainfall amounts predicted by the gentleman, leaving the Dragon King utterly shaken and terrified. After regaining his composure, he addressed the aquatic beings: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There truly are such spiritual individuals in this world! He truly possesses the ability to communicate with heaven and earth—there's no disputing it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe strategist Shiji reported, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty, rest assured. What difficulty could there be in defeating him? I have a small plan that will silence that fellow once and for all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King asked for details, and the strategist replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If we alter the timing of the rain slightly and reduce the amount just a bit, his predictions will clearly be inaccurate. Won't that be enough to prove him wrong? Then we can tear down his signboard, chase him away, and there'll be no trouble at all!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King approved the strategy without hesitation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, he summoned Feng Bo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu, and ascended into the nine heavens above Chang'an. At the appointed time, clouds began to form at Si hour, thunder rumbled at Wu hour, rain fell at Wei hour, and finally ceased at Shen hour—but the total rainfall amounted to only three feet and forty points, one hour earlier than predicted and three inches and eight points less than promised. After issuing orders for his generals to withdraw, he transformed himself back into the guise of a refined scholar dressed in white and headed straight for Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling shop on West Gate Street. Without a word, he smashed the shop's signboard, brush, inkstone, and everything else. Meanwhile, the gentleman calmly sat in his chair, completely unfazed. The Dragon King then picked up a door panel and began striking and shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You deceitful charlatan who spreads false prophecies and misleads the masses! Your divinations are useless, your words absurd! Today's predicted timing and rainfall don't match reality, yet you still sit there boldly. Leave now, or I'll spare your life no longer!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Yet Shoucheng remained utterly fearless, raising his head to the sky and coldly laughing, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've committed no crime, but you, on the other hand, very much have! You may fool others, but you can't fool me. I know exactly who you are—you're not a scholar at all, but the Dragon King of the Jing River. You violated the Jade Emperor's decree by altering the timing and reducing the rainfall, thus breaking heavenly law!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“You’re standing on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, where a fatal blow is inevitable—yet you still dare to scold me here?” Upon hearing this, the Dragon King was seized with fear, his hair standing on end. Hastily dropping the door panel, he straightened his clothes, bowed deeply, and knelt before the master, saying, “Please don’t take offense, Master. Those earlier words were merely spoken in jest; who could have foreseen that falsehood would become reality, and that I’d truly violated heavenly law? What can be done now? I beg you, Master, please save me!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t let you go.” Shoucheng replied, “I cannot save you myself, but I can point out a path for you to reincarnate.” The dragon said, “I humbly request your guidance.” The master continued, “Tomorrow at the third hour of noon, you are scheduled to appear before Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official, to be executed. If you truly wish to keep your life, you must quickly go and plead with Emperor Taizong of Tang, who reigns today. Wei Zheng is the chancellor under the Tang emperor; only by gaining his personal favor can you ensure safety.” Hearing this, the Dragon King bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnaware of how time had passed, the sun had already set in the west, and the moon rose high in the sky. One could see: mist condensed, mountains turned purple, crows weary as they returned home; travelers far from home sought refuge in inns. New geese perched on sandbanks by the ferry landing, and the Milky Way appeared. The watchman urged the passing of the night, while in the lonely village, lamplight flickered without flame. Smoke curled gently from hearths in quiet monasteries, and within butterfly dreams, people vanished from sight. The moon shifted, casting flower shadows onto the railing, stars twinkled wildly. The sound of dripping water marked the hours, and before one knew it, the deep night had already reached its midpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King of the Jing River did not return to his underwater palace. Instead, he remained in mid-air, waiting until around midnight, when he gathered his clouds and dispersed his mists, heading straight for the entrance of the imperial palace. At that very moment, Emperor Taizong was dreaming he had stepped outside the palace gates, walking beneath the moonlit flowers. Suddenly, the Dragon King transformed into human form and knelt before him, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong asked, “Who are you? How can I save you?” The Dragon King replied, “Your Majesty is a true dragon, while I am an ordinary dragon. Because I’ve broken heavenly law, I’m due to be executed by Your Majesty’s virtuous minister, Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. That’s why I’ve come to beg you—I implore Your Majesty to save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong said, “If Wei Zheng is to carry out the execution, then I can indeed save you. Go with peace of mind.” Overjoyed, the Dragon King bowed deeply in gratitude and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, after waking from his dream, Emperor Taizong couldn’t stop thinking about it. By dawn, at the third watch, Taizong convened court, gathering officials from both civil and military ranks. There, one could see:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmoke veiled the Phoenix Pavilion, fragrant incense filled the Dragon Tower. Light shimmered on the vermilion throne, clouds brushed past the emerald canopy. Ruler and ministers harmonized as though they were Yao and Shun, ritual music and decorum approached the grandeur of Han and Zhou. Courtiers held lamps, palace maids fanned themselves, their reflections glowing brightly; peacock screens and Kylin halls sparkled everywhere. All cried out “Long live the Emperor!” and offered blessings for ten thousand years. Three silent whips cracked, and all bowed in ceremonial attire before the imperial crown. Palace flowers bloomed brilliantly, their heavenly fragrance filling the air; willows along the embankment swayed gently, accompanied by imperial music. Pearl curtains and jade drapes hung high, secured by golden hooks; dragon-and-phoenix fans and mountain-and-river banners adorned the royal carriage as it paused. Civil officials stood elegant and refined, military generals proud and alert. The imperial road distinguished high from low, and ranks lined up on the vermilion platform. Golden seals and purple ribbons honored three great elephants, symbolizing enduring prosperity for countless ages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce the officials had finished their greetings and dispersed into their respective groups, Emperor Taizong, with eyes like phoenixes and dragon pupils, carefully examined each one from head to toe. Among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui, and others; among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaogin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, Qin Shubao, and many more—all dignified and solemn, yet Wei Zheng, the chancellor, was conspicuously absent. Emperor Taizong summoned Xu Shiji to the throne and said, “Last night, I had a strange dream. I dreamed someone came forward to pay homage, claiming to be the Dragon King of the Jing River, who had broken heavenly law and was due to be executed by Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. He begged me to save him, and I promised to do so. Yet today, Wei Zheng is nowhere to be seen among the officials assembled. Why is that?”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShiji replied, “This dream must be taken seriously. Wei Zheng will arrive shortly; Your Majesty must not let him leave the palace. Only by keeping him here for another day can we save the dragon from the dream.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDelighted, Emperor Taizong immediately issued an edict, ordering the imperial messenger to summon Wei Zheng to court.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Wei Zheng was at home, observing the celestial signs at night, burning precious incense, when suddenly he heard the cry of cranes echoing from the nine heavens. It was an envoy sent by Heaven, bearing a golden decree from the Jade Emperor, instructing him to execute the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream at the third hour of noon. Grateful for Heaven’s grace, Wei Zheng had already fasted and bathed, testing his wisdom sword and summoning his spiritual essence within his residence, which is why he hadn’t attended court. When the imperial messenger arrived with the decree, he was overcome with fear and anxiety, yet dared not disobey the emperor’s command. Thus, he hastily dressed and belted himself, taking the decree with him as he hurried to court, where he prostrated himself before the emperor and confessed his guilt.Emperor Tang issued an edict, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I hereby pardon you and declare you innocent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At that time, the ministers had not yet adjourned the court session. However, upon hearing these words, the emperor ordered the curtains to be drawn back and dismissed the assembly, leaving only Wei Zheng behind. He was summoned to the Golden Hall and then invited into the private audience chamber, where they first discussed strategies for ensuring peace within the realm and plans for stabilizing the country. As it neared the end of the fourth hour and the beginning of the fifth, the emperor instructed a palace attendant to bring out a large chessboard, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us play a game, my wise minister.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The imperial consorts promptly brought forth the chessboard and set it up on the royal desk.
