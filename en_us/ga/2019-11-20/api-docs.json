After you send a request, the system returns a request ID and runs the task in the background.

For more information, see [CreateAccelerator](~~206786~~).\n*   A bandwidth plan is associated with the standard GA instance. For more information, see [BandwidthPackageAddAccelerator](~~153239~~).\n*   An application is deployed to receive requests that are forwarded from GA. You can specify only vSwitches as endpoints for custom routing listeners.\n*   The permissions to use custom routing listeners are acquired and a custom routing listener is created for the GA instance. Custom routing listeners are in invitational preview. To use custom routing listeners, contact your account manager.

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:\n\n*   **CreateCustomRoutingEndpoints** is an asynchronous operation. After you send a request, the system returns a request ID and runs the task in the background. You can call the [DescribeCustomRoutingEndpointGroup](~~449373~~) operation to query the status of an endpoint group and determine whether endpoints are created in the endpoint group.\n\n    *   If the endpoint group is in the **updating** state, it indicates that endpoints are being created. In this case, you can perform only query operations.\n    *   If the endpoint group is in the **active** state, it indicates that endpoints are created.\n\n*   The **CreateCustomRoutingEndpoints** operation cannot be called repeatedly for the same GA instance within a specific period of time.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe following operations are complete before you call this operation:\n\n*   Create a standard GA instance. For more information, see [CreateAccelerator](~~206786~~).\n*   Associate a bandwidth plan with the standard GA instance. For more information, see [BandwidthPackageAddAccelerator](~~153239~~).\n*   Deploy an application that serves as the endpoint of the GA instance. The application is used to receive requests that are forwarded from GA. You can specify only vSwitches as endpoints for custom routing listeners.\n*   Apply for permissions to use custom routing listeners and create a custom routing listener for the standard GA instance. Custom routing listeners are in invitational preview. To use custom routing listeners, contact your account manager. For more information about how to create a custom routing listener, see [CreateListener](~~153253~~).\n*   Create an endpoint group for the custom routing listener.

You can specify only vSwitches as endpoints for custom routing listeners.\n*   The permissions to use custom routing listeners are acquired, and a custom routing listener is created. Custom routing listeners are in invitational preview. To use custom routing listeners, contact your account manager. For more information about how to create a custom routing listener, see [CreateListener](~~153253~~).\n*   Endpoint groups are created for the custom routing listener.

Valid values: `user-defined`, `ref`, and `system-defined`.\n    *   `value`: the content of the HTTP header. You cannot leave this parameter empty.

The content cannot start or end with a space character. If you set `type` to `system-defined`, only `ClientSrcIp` is supported.**\n\n*   If you set **RuleActionType** to **RemoveHeader**, this parameter specifies an HTTP header to be removed. If a forwarding rule contains a forwarding action whose type is **RemoveHeader**, you must specify another forwarding action whose type is **ForwardGroup**. The header must be 1 to 40 characters in length, and can contain letters, digits, hyphens (-), and underscores (\\_). Example: `[\"header1\"]`.\n\n*   If you set **RuleActionType** to **Rewrite**, this parameter specifies the rewriting configuration. If a forwarding rule contains a forwarding action whose type is **Rewrite**, you must specify another forwarding action whose type is **ForwardGroup**. Example: `{\"domain\":\"value1\", \"path\":\"value2\", \"query\":\"value3\"}`.\n\n    *   `domain`: the domain name to which requests are redirected. Default value: `${host}`. You can also enter a domain name. The domain name must be 3 to 128 characters in length, and can contain only lowercase letters, digits, and the following special characters: `. - ? = ~ _ - + / ^ * ! $ & | ( ) [ ]`.\n    *   `path`: the path to which requests are redirected. Default value: `${path}`. The path must be 1 to 128 characters in length. To use a regular expression, the path can contain letters, digits, and the following special characters: `. - _ / = ? ~ ^ * $ : ( ) [ ] + |`. The path must start with a tilde (~). If you do not want to use a regular expression, the path can contain letters, digits, and the following special characters: `. - _ / = ? :`. The path must start with a forward slash (/).\n    *   `query`: the query string to which requests are redirected. Default value: `${query}`. You can also specify a query string. The query string must be 1 to 128 characters in length, and can contain printable characters whose ASCII values are `greater than or equal to 32 and smaller than 127`. The query string cannot contain uppercase letters, space characters, or the following special characters: `[ ] { } < > # | &`.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"[{\"type\":\"endpointgroup\", \"value\":\"epg-bp1enpdcrqhl78g6r****\"}]"},"ForwardGroupConfig":{"description":"The forwarding configuration.\n\n>  We recommend that you use **RuleActionType** and **RuleActionValue** rather than this parameter to configure forwarding actions.\n","type":"object","properties":{"ServerGroupTuples":{"description":"The configuration of an endpoint group.\n\n>  We recommend that you use **RuleActionType** and **RuleActionValue** rather than this parameter to configure forwarding actions.\n","type":"array","items":{"description":"","type":"object","properties":{"EndpointGroupId":{"description":"The ID of an endpoint group.\n\n>  We recommend that you use **RuleActionType** and **RuleActionValue** rather than this parameter to configure forwarding actions.\n","type":"string","required":true,"example":"epg-bp1ieei9664r5nv****"}},"required":true},"required":true}},"required":false}},"required":true},"required":true,"maxItems":100,"minItems":1},"ForwardingRuleId":{"description":"The forwarding rule ID.\n","type":"string","required":true,"example":"frule-bp1dii16gu9qdvb34****"},"ForwardingRuleName":{"description":"The forwarding rule name.\n\nThe name must be 2 to 128 characters in length, and can contain letters, digits, periods (.), underscores (\\_), and hyphens (-).
