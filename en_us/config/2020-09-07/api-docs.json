Each account group can contain a maximum of 200 member accounts.\n\n### Background information\n\nFor more information about account groups, including their concepts, use cases, and the impact of member account changes on Cloud Config, see [Overview](~~211534~~).\n\nCloud Config supports the following types of account groups:\n\n- Global account group: A global account group contains all members in a resource directory and automatically synchronizes member changes. A management account or a delegated administrator account can create only one global account group.\n\n- Custom account group: To create a custom account group, a management account or a delegated administrator account selects some or all member accounts from the resource directory.\n\n  - If a new member is added to the resource directory, the change is not automatically synchronized. The management account or delegated administrator account must manually add the new member to the account group.\n\n  - If a member is removed from the resource directory, the management account or delegated administrator account loses the permissions to manage that member's compliance. The custom account group automatically detects this change and removes the member from the group.\n\n- Folder account group: When an account group is created from a folder, it automatically detects and synchronizes changes to the members within that folder. The members in a folder account group are always consistent with the members in the selected folder.\n\n  A management account or a delegated administrator account can select only one non-empty folder to create a folder account group.\n\n### Usage notes\n\nThis topic provides an example of how to use a management account to create a custom account group of the `CUSTOM` type. The account group is named `Test_Group` and has the description `Test Group`. The member accounts are as follows:\n\n- The member account ID is `171322098523****` and the member account name is `Alice`.\n\n- The member account ID is `100532098349****` and the member account name is `Tom`.","requestParamsDescription":"For information about common request parameters, see [Common parameters](~~251751~~).","changeSet":[],"flowControl":{"flowControlList":[{"threshold":"60","countWindow":60,"regionId":"*","api":"CreateAggregator"}]},"ramActions":[{"operationType":"create","ramAction":{"action":"config:CreateAggregator","authLevel":"resource","actionConditions":[],"resources":[{"validationType":"always","product":"Config","resourceType":"Aggregator","arn":"acs:config:*:{#accountId}:aggregator/*"}]}}]},"CreateCompliancePack":{"methods":["post"],"schemes":["http","https"],"security":[{"AK":[]}],"operationType":"write","deprecated":false,"systemTags":{"operationType":"create","riskType":"none","chargeType":"free","abilityTreeNodes":["FEATUREconfigZWSOST"]},"parameters":[{"name":"CompliancePackTemplateId","in":"formData","schema":{"description":"The ID of the compliance package template.\n\nYou can call the [ListCompliancePackTemplates](~~261176~~) operation to obtain the ID of the compliance package.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"ct-5f26ff4e06a300c4****"}},{"name":"CompliancePackName","in":"formData","schema":{"description":"The name of the compliance package.\n","type":"string","required":true,"docRequired":true,"example":"test-pack-name","maxLength":100}},{"name":"Description","in":"formData","schema":{"description":"The description of the compliance package.\n","type":"string","required":false,"example":"Test pack description.","maxLength":500}},{"name":"RiskLevel","in":"formData","schema":{"description":"The risk level of the resources that are not compliant with the rules in the compliance package.
