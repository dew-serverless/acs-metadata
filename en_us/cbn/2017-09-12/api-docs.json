These cloud services include Object Storage Service (OSS), Simple Log Service (SLS), and Data Transmission Service (DTS). If your on-premises network needs to access a cloud service, you must attach the virtual border router (VBR) or Cloud Connect Network (CCN) instance that is connected to your on-premises network to a Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) instance. In addition, you must attach a virtual private cloud (VPC) that is deployed in the same region as the cloud service to the CEN instance. This way, your on-premises network can connect to the VPC that is deployed in the same region as the cloud service and access the cloud service through the VPC.\n\n*   This operation is supported only by Basic Edition transit routers. An on-premises network associated with a VBR can use CEN to access only a cloud service that is deployed in the same region.\n\n    For example, if cloud services are deployed in the China (Beijing) region, only on-premises networks connected to VBRs in the China (Beijing) region can access the cloud services.\n\n*   **ResolveAndRouteServiceInCen** is an asynchronous operation. After a request is sent, the system returns a **request ID** and runs the task in the background.

After you attach virtual border routers (VBRs) and Cloud Connect Network (CCN) instances to a Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) instance, you can enable the on-premises networks connected to the VBRs and CCN instances to access PrivateZone through the CEN instance. \n\n#### Usage notes\n\n- The on-premises networks connected to VBRs or CCN instances must be deployed in the same region as the PrivateZone service. For example, if the PrivateZone service is deployed in the China (Beijing) region, only on-premises networks connected to VBRs or CCN instances in the China (Beijing) region can access the PrivateZone service. \n- **RoutePrivateZoneInCenToVpc** is an asynchronous operation. After you send a request, the **request ID** is returned but the operation is still being performed in the system background. You can call **DescribeCenPrivateZoneRoutes** to query the status of PrivateZone. \n    - If PrivateZone is in the **Creating** state, access to PrivateZone is being configured. In this case, you can query PrivateZone configurations but cannot perform other operations. \n    - If PrivateZone is in the **Active** state, access to PrivateZone is enabled. \n    - If PrivateZone is in the **Failed** state, configurations of access to PrivateZone failed. \n\n#### Prerequisites\nBefore you call **RoutePrivateZoneInCenToVpc**, make sure that the following conditions are met:\n\n- PrivateZone is deployed. For more information, see [PrivateZone quick start](~~64627~~).\n- The following network instances are attached to the same CEN instance: the VPC that is associated with the PrivateZone service, and the VBR and CCN instance that want to access the PrivateZone service. For more information, see [AttachCenChildInstance](~~468684~~). \n- If your on-premises network uses a CCN instance to connect to Alibaba Cloud and the account that owns the CCN instance is different from the account that owns the VPC or CEN instance, you must grant the CCN instance required permissions. For more information, see [Grant permissions to CCN](~~181654~~).","requestParamsDescription":" ","responseParamsDescription":" ","extraInfo":" "},"CreateTransitRouterMulticastDomain":{"summary":"Creates a multicast domain.

Before you create a flow log, take note of the following items:\n\n*   Flow logs are supported only by Enterprise Edition transit routers.\n\n*   Flow logs are used to capture information about outbound traffic on transit routers. Information about inbound traffic on transit routers is not captured.\n\n    For example, an Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance in the US (Silicon Valley) region accesses an ECS instance in the US (Virginia) region through Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN). After you enable the flow log feature for the transit router in the US (Virginia) region, you can check the log entries about packets sent from the ECS instance in the US (Virginia) region to the ECS instance in the US (Silicon Valley) region. However, packets sent from the ECS instance in the US (Silicon Valley) region to the ECS instance in the US (Virginia) region are not recorded. If you want to record the packets sent from the ECS instance in the US (Silicon Valley) region to the ECS instance in the US (Virginia) region, you must also enable the flow log feature on the transit router that is in the US (Silicon Valley) region.\n\n*   If you use a flow log to capture traffic information about VPC connections, the flow log captures information only about traffic on the elastic network interface (ENI) of the transit router. For more information about how to view traffic information about other ENIs in the VPC, see [VPC flow log overview](~~127150~~).\n\n*   `CreateFlowLog` is an asynchronous operation. After a request is sent, the system returns a request ID and runs the task in the background. You can call the `DescribeFlowlogs` operation to query the status of a flow log.\n\n    *   If the flow log is in the **Creating** state, the flow log is being created. In this case, you can query the flow log but cannot perform other operations.\n    *   If the flow log is in the **Active** state, the flow log is created.\n\n### [](#)Prerequisites\n\nRequired resources are created.
