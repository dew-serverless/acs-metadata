After you submit transcoding jobs, the jobs are added to an MPS queue to be scheduled and run. The transcoding jobs may not have been complete when the response is returned. After you call this operation, you can call the [QueryJobList](~~602836~~) operation to query the job results. You can also associate a Message Service (MNS) queue or topic with the MPS queue to receive notifications on the jobs. For more information, see [Receive notifications](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/apsaravideo-for-media-processing/latest/receive-message-notifications).\n*   An input file can be up to 100 GB in size. If the size of the input file exceeds this limit, the job may fail.\n*   If you use an **intelligent preset template** to transcode an input file, you must first call the [SubmitAnalysisJob](~~29223~~) operation to submit a preset template analysis job. After the analysis job is complete, you can call the [QueryAnalysisJobList](~~29224~~)operation to obtain the available preset templates for the input file. When you submit a transcoding job, set TemplateId to the ID of an available preset template. If you specify a preset template that is not in the available preset templates, the transcoding job fails.\n*   If you use a **static preset template** to transcode an input file, you do not need to submit a preset template analysis job.\n*   If you want to use multiple accounts in MPS, you can create Resource Access Management (RAM) users by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

If yes, the workflow matches the input file and runs. Otherwise, the workflow does not match the input file and does not run.

Otherwise, two workflow execution instances will be triggered for adding one media file. For example, if you specify the test folder for the first workflow triggering rule and the test1 folder for the second workflow triggering rule, the two workflows are triggered when a media file is added to the test1 folder.\n\n**File name extension matching**\n\nOnly multimedia files can trigger workflows. MPS determines whether to trigger a workflow by checking the file name extensions. A workflow is matched for a file that does not have a file name extension or a file with the name extension described in the following table. A file that does not have a file name extension has no separator dot in the file name.\n\n**Note**For SWF files, the snapshot and transcoding features may not deliver optimal performance.\n\n|Type|File name extension|\n|:---|:---|\n|Video|3gp, asf, avi, dat, dv, flv, f4v, gif, m2t, m3u8, m4v, mj2, mjpeg, mkv, mov, mp4, mpe, mpg, mpeg, mts, ogg, qt, rm, rmvb, swf, ts, vob, wmv, webm|\n|Audio|aac, ac3, acm, amr, ape, caf, flac, m4a, mp3, ra, wav, wma, aiff|\n\n\n**Media workflow message**\n\nMedia workflows use [Alibaba Cloud Message Service (MNS)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/mns?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.10.6c44478epkHm97) to send messages to MPS service users.
