# Alibaba Cloud API metadata

This repository provides Alibaba Cloud API metadata sourced from Alibaba Cloud
[Openmeta]. By assigning version control, it simplifies the management of the
[ACS PHP SDK] development cycle and its [documentation].

The metadata is refreshed **weekly** from the upstream, with PHP array
representations automatically generated for each update. Contributions are
encouragedâ€”feel free to submit a pull request to expand the metadata's
applications.
