   这一篇词，名《苏武慢》。话表我佛如来，辞别了玉帝，回至雷音宝刹，但见那三千诸佛、五百阿罗、八大金刚、无边菩萨，一个个都执着幢幡宝盖，异宝仙花，摆列在灵山仙境．婆罗双林之下接迎。如来驾住祥云，对众道：“我以甚深般苦，遍现三界。根本性原，毕竟寂灭。同虚空相，一无所有。殄伏乖猴．是事莫识。名生死始，法相如。”说罢，放舍利之光，满空有白虹四十二道，南北通连。大众见了，皈身礼拜。少顷间，聚庆云彩雾，登上品莲台，端然坐下。那三千诸佛、五百罗汉、八金刚、四菩萨合掌近前礼毕，问日：“闹天宫搅乱皤桃者，谁也？”如来道：“那厮乃花果山产的一妖猴，罪恶滔天，不可名状。概天神将，俱莫能降伏，虽二郎捉获。老君用火锻炼，亦莫能伤损。我去时，正在雷将中间，扬威耀武，卖弄精神，被我止住兵戈，问他来历。他言有神通，会变化，又驾筋斗云．一去十万八千里。我与他打了个赌赛，他出不得我手，却将他一把抓住，指化五行山，封压他在那里。五帝大开金阙瑶宫，请我坐了首席．立安天大会谢我，却方辞驾而回。”\\n    大众听言喜悦，极口称扬。谢罢，各分班而退，各执乃事，共乐天真。果然是：\\n    瑞霭漫天竺，虹光拥世尊。西方称第一，无相法王门！常见玄猿献果，糜鹿衔花；青鸾舞，彩凤鸣；灵龟捧寿，仙鹤擒芝。安享净土袛园，受用龙宫法界。日日开花，时时果熟，习静归真，参禅果正。不灭不生，不增不减。烟霞缥缈随来往，寒暑无侵不记年。\\n    诗曰：\\n    去来自在任优游，也无恐怖也无愁。极乐场中俱坦荡，大千之处没春秋。\\n    佛祖居一月灵山大雷音宝刹之间，一日，唤聚诸佛，阿罗、揭谛。菩萨、金刚、比丘增、尼等众，曰：“自伏乖猿，安天之后，我处不知年月，料凡间有半千年矣，今值孟秋望日。我有一宝盆．具设百样花，千般异果等物，与法等享此‘孟兰盆会’，如何？”慨众一个个合掌，礼佛三匝．领会。如来却将宝盆中花果品物，着阿傩捧走，着迎叶布散、大众感激。各献诗伸谢。\\n    福诗曰：\\n    福圣光耀性尊前，福纳弥深远更绵。福德无疆同地久，福缘有庆与天连。福田广种年年盛，福海洪深岁岁坚。福满乾坤多福荫，福增无量永周全。\\n    禄诗曰：\\n    禄重如山彩凤鸣，禄随时泰视长庚。禄添万斛身康健，禄享千钟也太平。禄俸齐天还永固，禄名似海更澄清。禄思远继多瞻仰，禄爵无边万国荣。\\n    寿诗曰：\\n    寿星献彩对如来．寿域光华自此开。寿果满盘生瑞霭，寿花新采插莲台。寿诗清雅多奇妙，寿曲调音按美才。寿命延长同日月，寿如山海更悠哉。\\n    众菩萨献毕，因请如来明示根本，指解源流。那如来微开善口，敷演大法，宣扬正果，讲的是三乘妙典，五蕴得严。但见那天龙同绕，花雨缤纷。正是：“禅心朗照千江月，真性情涵万里天。”如来讲罢，对众言回：“我现四大部洲，众生善恶，各方不一：东胜神洲者．敬天礼地，。心爽气平；北巨芦洲者，虽好亲生，只因糊口，性拙情流．无多作践；我西牛贺洲者，不贪不杀，养气潜灵，虽无上真，人人固寿；但那南赠部洲者，贪淫乐祸，多杀多争，正所谓口舌凶场，是非恶海。我今有三藏真经，可以劝人为善。”\\n    诸菩萨闻言，合掌皈依，向佛前问曰：“如来有哪三藏真经7”如来回：“我有法一藏，谈天；论一藏，说地；经一藏，度鬼；三藏共计三十五部，该一万五千一百四十四卷，乃是修真之径，正善之门。我待要送上东土，叵耐那方众生愚蠢，毁谤真言，不识我法门之要旨，怠慢了瑜迦之正宗。怎么得一个有法力的，去东土寻一个善信．教他苦历千山，远经万水，到我处求取真经，永传东土，劝他众生，却乃是个山大的福缘，海深的善庆、谁肯去走一遭来？”当有观音菩萨，行近莲台．礼佛三匝，道：“弟子不才，愿上东土寻一个取经人来也。”诸众抬头观看，那菩萨：\\n    理圆四德，智满金身。缨络垂珠翠，香环结宝明，乌云巧叠盘龙警，绣带轻飘彩凤翎。碧玉纽，素罗袍，祥光笼罩；锦城裙，金落索，瑞气遮迎。眉如小月，眼似双星。五面天生喜，朱唇一点红。净瓶甘露年年盛，斜插垂杨岁岁青。解八难，度群生，大慈悯：故镇大山，居南海，救苦寻声，万称万应，千圣千灵。兰心欣紫竹，意性爱香藤。他是落伽山上慈悲主，潮音洞里活观音。\\n    如来见了，心中大喜，道：“别个是也去不得，须是观音尊者、神通广大，方可去得。”菩萨道；“弟子此去东土，有甚言语吩咐？”如来道；“这一去。要踏看路道，不许在霄汉中行，须是要半云半雾；目过山水，谨记程途远近之数，叮咛那取经人。但恐善信难行，我与你五件宝贝。”即命阿傩、迦叶，取出“锦澜袈裟”一领，“九环锡杖”一根，对菩萨言回；“这袈裟、锡杖。可与那取经人亲用。若肯坚心来此，穿我的袈裟，免堕轮回；持我的锡枚，不遭毒害。”\\n    这菩萨皈依拜领，如来又取三个箍儿，递与菩萨道：“此宝唤做‘紧箍儿’，虽是一样三个，但只是用各不同。我有‘金紧禁’的咒语三篇。假若路上撞见神通广大的妖魔。你须是劝他学好，跟那取经人做个徒弟。他若不伏使唤，可将此箍儿与他带在头上，自然见肉生根。各依所用的咒语念一念，眼胀头痛，脑门皆裂，管教他入我门来。”\\n    那菩萨闻言，踊跃作礼而退，即唤惠岸行者随行。那惠岸使一条浑铁棍，重有千斤，只在菩萨左右作一个降魔的大力士。菩萨遂将镜湖袈裟作一个包裹，令他背了。菩萨将金箍藏了，执了锡枚，径下灵山。这一去，有分教：佛子还来归本愿，金蝉长老裹￥檀。\\n    那菩萨到山脚下，有玉真观金顶大仙，在观门首接住，请菩萨献茶。菩萨不敢久停，对大仙曰；“今领如来法旨，上东土寻取经人去。”大仙道：“取经人几时方到？”菩萨道：“未定，约莫二三年间，或可至此。”遂辞了大仙，半云半雾，约记程途。有诗为证。诗曰:万里相寻自不言，却云谁得意难全？求人忽若浑如此，是我平生岂偶然？传道有方成是语，说明无信也虚传。愿倾肝胆寻相识，料想前头必有缘。\\n    师徒二人正走间．忽然见弱水三千，乃是流沙河界。菩萨道：\\n    “徒弟呀．此处却是难行。取经人浊骨凡胎，如何得渡了”惠岸道：“师父，你看河有多远？”那菩萨停云步看时．只见：\\n    东连沙碛，两抵诸番；南达乌戈，北通鞑靼。径过有八百里遥．上下有千万里远。水流一似地翻身，浪滚却如山耸背。洋洋浩浩，漠漠茫茫，十里遥闻万丈洪。仙槎难到此，莲叶莫能浮。衰草斜阳流曲浦，黄云影日暗长堤。那里得客商来往？何曾有渔叟依栖？平沙无雁落，远岸有猿啼。只是红蓼花絮知景色，白苹香细任依依。\\n    菩萨正然点看，只见那河中，泼刺一声响亮，水波里跳出一个妖魔来，十分丑恶。他生得：\\n    青不青，黑不黑，晦气色脸；长不长，短不短，赤脚筋躯。眼光闪烁，好似灶底双灯；口角角丫叉．就如屠家火钵。撩牙撑剑刃，红发乱蓬松。一声叱咤如雷吼，两脚奔波似滚风。\\n    那怪物手执一根宝杖，走上岸就捉菩萨．却被惠岸掣浑铁棒挡住，喝声：“休走！”那怪物就持定杖来迎。两个在流沙河边。这一场恶杀，真个惊人：\\n    木吒浑铁棒，护法显神通；怪物降妖杖，努力逞英雄。双条银蟒河边舞，一对神谱岸上冲。那一个威镇流沙施本事，这一个力保观音建大功。那一个翻波跃浪．这一个吐雾喷云。翻波跃浪乾坤暗，吐雾喷云日月昏。那个降妖杖，好便似出山的白虎；这个浑铁棒，却就如卧道的黄龙。那个使将来．寻蛇拨草；这个丢开去，扑鹞分松。只杀得昏漠漠，星辰灿烂；雾腾腾，天地腾胧。那个久住弱水惟他狠。这个初出灵山第一功。\\n    他两个来来往往，战上数十合，不分胜负。那怪物架住了铁棒道；“你是哪里和尚，敢来与我抵敌？”木吒道：“我是托塔天王二太子木吒惠岸行者，今保我师父往东土寻取经人去。你是何怪，敢大胆阻路？”那怪方才醒悟道：“我记得你踉南海观音在紫竹林中修行，你为何来此？”木呼道：“那岸上不是我师父？”\\n    怪物闻言，连声喏喏，收了宝杖，让木吒揪了去见观音。纳头下拜，告道：“菩萨，恕我之罪，待我诉告。我不是妖邪，我是灵霄殿下侍銮舆的卷帘大将。只因在蟋桃会上，失手打碎了玻璃盏，玉帝把我打了八百，贬下界来，变得这般模样；又教七日一次，将飞剑来穿我胸胁百余下方回，故此这般苦恼。没奈何，饥寒难忍，三二日间，出波涛寻一个行人食用。不期今日无知，冲撞了大慈菩萨。”菩萨道：“你在天有罪，既贬下来，今又这等伤生，正所谓罪上加罪。我今领了佛旨．上东上寻取经人。你何不入我门来，皈依善果，跟那取经人做个徒弟，上西天拜佛求经？我教飞剑不来穿你。那时节功成免罪，复你本职，心下如何？”\\n    那怪道：“我愿皈正果。”乃向前道：“菩萨，我在此间吃人无数，向来有几次取经人来，都被我吃了。凡吃的人头，抛落流沙，竟沉水底（这个水，鹅毛也不能浮），惟有九个取经人的骷髅，浮在水面，再不能沉。我以为异物，将索儿穿在一处，闲时拿来顽耍，这去，但恐取经人不得到此，却不是反误了我的前程也？”菩萨日：“岂有不到之理？你可将骷髅地挂在头顶下，等候取经入，自有用处。”怪物道：“既然如此，愿领教诲。”菩萨方与他摩项受戒，指沙为姓，就姓了沙，起个法名，叫做个沙悟净。当时入了沙门，送菩萨过了河，他洗心涤虑．再不伤生，专等取经人。\\n    菩萨与他别了，同木吒径奔东土。行了多时，又见一座高山，山上有恶气遮漫，不能步上。正欲驾云过山，不觉狂风起处，又闪上一个妖魔。他生得又甚凶险：\\n    卷上莲蓬吊搭嘴，耳如蒲扇显金睛。獠牙锋利如钢挫，长嘴张开似火盆。金盔紧系腮边带，勒甲丝绦蟒退鳞。手执钉把龙探爪，腰挎弯弓月十轮。纠纠威风欺太岁，昂昂志气压天神。他撞上来，不分好歹，望菩萨，举钉把就筑，被木呼行者挡住，大喝一声道：“那泼怪，休得无礼！看棒！”妖魔道：“这和尚不知死活！看钯！”两个在山底下，一冲一撞，赌斗输赢。真个好杀；\\n    妖魔凶猛，惠岸威能。铁棒分心捣，钉钻劈面迎。播土扬尘天地暗，飞砂走石鬼神惊。九齿钯，光耀耀，双环响亮；一条棒，黑悠悠，两手飞腾。这个是天王太子，那个是元帅精灵。一个在普陀为护法，一个在山洞作妖精。这场相遇争高下，不知那个亏输那个赢。\\n    他两个正杀到好处，观世音在半空中，抛下莲花，隔开钯杖。怪物见了心惊，便问：“你是哪里和尚，敢弄甚么‘眼前花’哄我？”木吒道：“我把你这个肉眼凡胎的泼物！我是南海菩萨的徒弟。这是我师父抛来的莲花，你也不认得哩！”那怪道：“南海菩萨，可是扫三灾救八难的观世音么？”木吐道：“不是他是谁？”怪物撇了钉把，纳头下礼道；“老兄，菩萨在哪里？累烦你引见一引见。”木吐仰面指道：“哪不是？”怪物朝上磕头，厉声高叫道：“菩萨，恕罪！恕罪！”\\n    观音按下云头，前来问道：“你是那里成精的野豕，何方作怪的老彘，敢在此间挡我？”那怪道：“我不是野豕，亦不是老彘，我本是天河里天蓬元帅。只因带酒戏弄嫦娥，玉帝把我打了二千锤，贬下尘凡；一灵真性，竟来夺舍投胎，不期错了道路，投在个母猪胎里，变得这般模样。是我咬杀母猪，打死群彘，在此处占了山场，吃人度日。不期撞着菩萨，万望拨救拔救。”塔萨道：“此山叫做甚么山？”怪物道：“叫做福陵山。山中有一洞，叫做云栈洞。洞里原有个卵二姐。\\n    他见我有些武艺，把我做个家长，又唤做‘倒查门’。不上一年，他死了，将一洞的家当尽归我受用。在此日久年深，没有个赡身的勾当．菩萨道：“古人云：‘若要有前程，莫做没前程。’你既上界违法．今又不改凶心，伤生造孽，却不是二罪俱罚？”那怪道：“前程！前程！若依你，教我喝风！常言道：‘依着官法打杀，依着佛法饿杀。’去也！去也！还不如捉个行人，肥腻腻的吃他家娘！管甚么二罪，三罪，千罪，万罪！”菩萨道：“‘人有善愿，天必从之。’汝若肯皈依正果，自有养身之处。世有五谷，尽能济饥，为何吃人度日？\\n    怪物闻言，似梦方觉，向菩萨道：“我欲从正，奈何‘获罪于天，无所祷也’！”菩萨道：“我领了佛旨，上东土寻取经人。你可跟他做个徒弟，往西天走一遭来，将功折罪，管教你脱离灾瘴。”那怪满口道：“愿随！愿随！”菩萨才与他摩顶受戒，指身为姓，就姓了猪，替他起个法名，就叫做猪悟能。遂此领命归真，持斋把素，断绝了五荤三厌，专候那取经人。\\n    菩萨却与木吒，辞了悟能，半兴云雾前来、正走处，只见空中有一条玉龙叫唤。菩萨近前问日：“你是何龙，在此受罪？”那龙道：“我是西海龙王敖闰之子。因纵火烧了殿上明珠，我父王表奏天庭，告了忤逆。五帝把我吊在空中。打了三百，不日遭诛。望菩萨搭救搭救。”\\n    观音闻言。即与木吒撞上南天门里。早有丘、张二天师接着，问道：“何往？”菩萨道：“贫僧要见玉帝一面。”二天师即忙上奏。玉帝遂下殿迎接。菩萨上前礼毕道：“贫僧领佛旨上东土寻取经人，路遇孽龙悬吊，特来启奏，饶地性命，赐与贫僧，教他与取经人做个脚力。”五帝闻言，即传旨赦宥，差天将解放，送与菩萨。菩萨谢恩而出。这小龙叩头谢活命之恩，听从菩萨使唤。菩萨把他送在深涧之中，只等取经人来，变做白马，上西方立功。小龙领命潜身不题。\\n    菩萨带引木吒行者过了此山，又奔东土。行不多时，忽见金光万道，瑞气千条。木吒道：“师父，那放光之处，乃是五行山了：见有如来的‘压帖’在那里。”菩萨道：“此却是那搅乱皤桃会大闹天宫的齐天大圣，今乃压在此也。”木吒道：“正是，正是。”师徒俱上山来，观看帖子，乃是“唵嘛呢叭[口迷]吽”六字真言。菩萨看罢，叹惜不已，作诗一首。诗曰：\\n    堪叹妖猴不奉公，当年狂妄逞英雄。欺心搅乱皤桃会，大胆私行兜率宫。十万军中无敌手．九重天上有威风。自遭我佛如来困，何日舒伸再显功！\\n    师徒们正说话处，早惊动了那大圣。大全在山根下，高叫道：\\n    “是那个在山上吟诗，揭我的短哩？”菩萨闻言，径下山来寻着。只见那石崖之下，有土地、山神、监押大圣的天将，都来拜接了菩萨，引至那大圣面前。看时，他原来压于石匣之中，口能言，身不能动。菩萨道：“姓孙的，你认得我么？”大圣睁开火眼金睛，点着头儿高叫道；“我怎么不认得你。你好的是那南海普陀落伽山救苦救难大慈大悲南无观世音菩萨。承看顾！承看顾！我在此度日如年，更无一个相知的来看我一看。你从哪里来也？”菩萨道：“我奉佛旨，上东土寻取经人去，从此经过，特留残步看你。”大圣道：“如来哄了我，把我压在此山，五百余年了，不能展挣，万望菩萨方便一二，救我老孙一救！”菩萨道；“你这厮罪业弥深，救你出来，恐你又生祸害。反为不美。”大圣道：“我已知悔了，但愿大慈悲指条门路，情愿修行。”这才是：\\n    人心生一念，天地尽皆知。善恶若无报，乾坤必有私。\\n    那菩萨闻得此言，满心欢喜，对大圣道：“圣经云：‘出其言善。\\n    则千里之外应之；出其言不善，则千里之外适之。’你既有此心，待我到了东土大唐国寻一个取经的人来，教他救你。你可跟他做个徒弟，秉教伽持，入我佛门。再修正果，如何？”大圣声声道：“愿去！愿去！”菩萨道：“既有善果，我与你起个法名。”大圣道：“我已有名了，叫做孙悟空。”菩萨又喜道：“我前面也有二人归降，正是‘悟’字排行。你今也是‘悟’字，却与他相合，甚好，甚好。这等也不消叮嘱，我去也。”那大圣见性明心归佛教，这菩萨留情在意访神谱。\\n    他与木吒离了此处，一直东来，不一日就到了长安大唐国。敛雾收云，师徒们变作两个疥癫游憎，入长安城里，竟不觉天晚。行至大市街旁，见一座土地庙祠，二人径进，唬得那土地心慌，鬼兵胆战。知是菩萨，叩头接入。那土地又急跑报与城隍社令及满长安城各庙神抵，都来参见，告道：“菩萨，恕众神接迟之罪。”菩萨道：“汝等不可走漏消息。我奉佛旨，特来此处寻访取经人。借你庙宇，权住几日，待访着真僧即回。”众神各归本处，把个土地赶到城隍庙里暂住，他师徒们隐遁真形。\\n    毕竟不知寻出那个取经来，且听下回分解。\\n《》目录 附录　陈光蕊赴任逢灾　江流僧复仇报本\\n    话表陕西大国长安城，乃历代帝王建都之地。自周、秦、汉以来，三州花似锦，八水绕城流，真个是名胜之邦。彼时是大唐太宗皇帝登基，改元贞观，已登极十三年，岁在己巳，天下太平，八方进贡，四海称臣。忽一日，太宗登位，聚集文武众官，朝拜礼毕，有魏征丞相出班奏道：“方今天下太平，八方宁静，应依古法，开立选场，招取贤士，擢用人材，以资化理。”太宗道：\\n    “贤卿所奏有理。”就传招贤文榜，颁布天下：各府州县，不拘军民人等，但有读书儒流，文义明畅，三场精通者，前赴长安应试。\\n    此榜行至海州地方，有一人姓陈名萼，表字光蕊，见了此榜，即时回家，对母张氏道：“朝廷颁下黄榜，诏开南省，考取贤才，孩儿意欲前去应试。倘得一官半职，显亲扬名，封妻荫子，光耀门闾，乃儿之志也。特此禀告母亲前去。”张氏道：“我儿读书人，‘幼而学，壮而行’，正该如此。但去赴举，路上须要小心，得了官，早早回来。”光蕊便吩咐家僮收拾行李，即拜辞母亲，趱程前进。到了长安，正值大开选场，光蕊就进场。考毕中选，及廷试三策，唐王御笔亲赐状元，跨马游街三日。不期游到丞相殷开山门首，有丞相所生一女，名唤温娇，又名满堂娇，未曾婚配，正高结彩楼，抛打绣球卜婿。适值陈光蕊在楼下经过，小姐一见光蕊人材出众，知是新科状元，心内十分欢喜，就将绣球抛下，恰打着光蕊的乌纱帽。猛听得一派笙箫细乐，十数个婢妾走下楼来，把光蕊马头挽住，迎状元入相府成婚。那丞相和夫人，即时出堂，唤宾人赞礼，将小姐配与光蕊。拜了天地，夫妻交拜毕，又拜了岳丈岳母。丞相吩咐安排酒席，欢饮一宵。\\n    二人同携素手，共入兰房。次日五更三点，太宗驾坐金銮宝殿，文武众臣趋朝。太宗同道：“新科状元陈光蕊应授何官？”魏征丞相奏道：“臣查所属州郡，有江州缺官。乞我主授他此职。”太宗就命为江州州主，即令收拾起身，勿误限期。光蕊谢恩出朝，回到相府，与妻商议，拜辞岳丈岳母，同妻前赴江州之任。\\n    离了长安登途，正是暮春天气，和风吹柳绿，细雨点花红。\\n    光蕊便道回家，同妻交拜母亲张氏。张氏道：“恭喜我儿，且又娶亲回来。”光蕊道：“孩儿叨赖母亲福庇，忝中状元，钦赐游街，经过丞相殷府门前，遇抛打绣球适中，蒙丞相即将小姐招孩儿为婿。朝廷除孩儿为江州州主，今来接取母亲，同去赴任。”张氏大喜，收拾行程。在路数日，前至万花店刘小二家安下，张氏身体忽然染病，与光蕊道：“我身上不安，且在店中调养两日再去。”光蕊遵命。至次日早晨，见店门前有一人提着个金色鲤鱼叫卖，光蕊即将一贯钱买了，欲待烹与母亲吃，只见鲤鱼闪闪咪眼，光蕊惊异道：“闻说鱼蛇咪眼，必不是等闲之物！”遂问渔人道：“这鱼那里打来的？”渔人道：“离府十五里洪江内打来的。”光蕊就把鱼送在洪江里去放了生。回店对母亲道知此事，张氏道：“放生好事，我心甚喜。”光蕊道：“此店已住三日了，钦限紧急，孩儿意欲明日起身，不知母亲身体好否？”\\n    张氏道：“我身子不快，此时路上炎热，恐添疾病。你可这里赁间房屋，与我暂住。付些盘缠在此，你两口儿先上任去，候秋凉却来接我。”光蕊与妻商议，就租了屋宇，付了盘缠与母亲，同妻拜辞前去。\\n    途路艰苦，晓行夜宿，不觉已到洪江渡口。只见稍水刘洪、李彪二人，撑船到岸迎接。也是光蕊前生合当有此灾难，撞着这冤家。光蕊令家僮将行李搬上船去，夫妻正齐齐上船，那刘洪睁眼看见殷小姐面如满月，眼似秋波，樱桃小口，绿柳蛮腰，真个有沉鱼落雁之容，闭月羞花之貌，陡起狼心，遂与李彪设计，将船撑至没人烟处，候至夜静三更，先将家僮杀死，次将光蕊打死，把尸首都推在水里去了。小姐见他打死了丈夫，也便将身赴水，刘洪一把抱住道：“你若从我，万事皆休！若不从时，一刀两断！”那小姐寻思无计，只得权时应承，顺了刘洪。那贼把船渡到南岸，将船付与李彪自管，他就穿了光蕊衣冠，带了官凭，同小姐往江州上任去了。\\n    却说刘洪杀死的家僮尸首，顺水流去，惟有陈光蕊的尸首，沉在水底不动。有洪江口巡海夜叉见了，星飞报入龙宫，正值龙王升殿，夜叉报道：“今洪江口不知甚人把一个读书士子打死，将尸撇在水底。”龙王叫将尸抬来，放在面前，仔细一看道：“此人正是救我的恩人，如何被人谋死？常言道，恩将恩报。\\n    我今日须索救他性命，以报日前之恩。”即写下牒文一道，差夜叉径往洪州城隍土地处投下，要取秀才魂魄来，救他的性命。\\n    城隍土地遂唤小鬼把陈光蕊的魂魄交付与夜叉去，夜叉带了魂魄到水晶宫，禀见了龙王。龙王问道：“你这秀才，姓甚名谁？\\n    何方人氏？因甚到此，被人打死？”光蕊施礼道：“小生陈萼，表字光蕊，系海州弘农县人。忝中新科状元，叨授江州州主，同妻赴任，行至江边上船，不料稍子刘洪，贪谋我妻，将我打死抛尸，乞大王救我一救！”龙王闻言道：“原来如此，先生，你前者所放金色鲤鱼即我也，你是救我的恩人，你今有难，我岂有不救你之理？”就把光蕊尸身安置一壁，口内含一颗定颜珠，休教损坏了，日后好还魂报仇。又道：“汝今真魂，权且在我水府中做个都领。”光蕊叩头拜谢，龙王设宴相待不题。\\n    却说殷小姐痛恨刘贼，恨不食肉寝皮，只因身怀有孕，未知男女，万不得已，权且勉强相从。转盼之间，不觉已到江州。\\n    吏书门皂，俱来迎接。所属官员，公堂设宴相叙。刘洪道：“学生到此，全赖诸公大力匡持。”属官答道：“堂尊大魁高才，自然视民如子，讼简刑清。我等合属有赖，何必过谦？”公宴已罢，众人各散。\\n    光阴迅速。一日，刘洪公事远出，小姐在衙思念婆婆、丈夫，在花亭上感叹，忽然身体困倦，腹内疼痛，晕闷在地，不觉生下一子。耳边有人嘱曰：“满堂娇，听吾叮嘱。吾乃南极星君，奉观音菩萨法旨，特送此子与你，异日声名远大，非比等闲。刘贼若回，必害此子，汝可用心保护。汝夫已得龙王相救，日后夫妻相会，子母团圆，雪冤报仇有日也。谨记吾言，快醒快醒！”言讫而去。小姐醒来，句句记得，将子抱定，无计可施。忽然刘洪回来，一见此子，便要淹杀，小姐道：“今日天色已晚，容待明日抛去江中。”幸喜次早刘洪忽有紧急公事远出，小姐暗思：“此子若待贼人回来，性命休矣！不如及早抛弃江中，听其生死。倘或皇天见怜，有人救得，收养此子，他日还得相逢。”但恐难以识认，即咬破手指，写下血书一纸，将父母姓名、跟脚原由，备细开载；又将此子左脚上一个小指，用口咬下，以为记验。取贴身汗衫一件，包裹此子，乘空抱出衙门。幸喜官衙离江不远，小姐到了江边，大哭一场。正欲抛弃，忽见江岸岸侧飘起一片木板，小姐即朝天拜祷，将此子安在板上，用带缚住，血书系在胸前，推放江中，听其所之。小姐含泪回衙不题。\\n    却说此子在木板上，顺水流去，一直流到金山寺脚下停住。那金山寺长老叫做法明和尚，修真悟道，已得无生妙诀。正当打坐参禅，忽闻得小儿啼哭之声，一时心动，急到江边观看，只见涯边一片木板上，睡着一个婴儿，长老慌忙救起。见了怀中血书，方知来历，取个乳名，叫做江流，托人抚养，血书紧紧收藏。光阴似箭，日月如梭，不觉江流年长一十八岁。长老就叫他削发修行，取法名为玄奘，摩顶受戒，坚心修道。\\n    一日，暮春天气，众人同在松阴之下，讲经参禅，谈说奥妙。那酒肉和尚恰被玄奘难倒，和尚大怒骂道：“你这业畜，姓名也不知，父母也不识，还在此捣甚么鬼！”玄奘被他骂出这般言语，入寺跪告师父，眼泪双流道：“人生于天地之间，禀阴阳而资五行，尽由父生母养，岂有为人在世而无父母者乎？”再三哀告，求问父母姓名。长老道：“你真个要寻父母，可随我到方丈里来。”玄奘就跟到方丈，长老到重梁之上，取下一个小匣儿，打开来取出血书一纸，汗衫一件，付与玄奘。玄奘将血书拆开读之，才备细晓得父母姓名，并冤仇事迹。玄奘读罢，不觉哭倒在地道：“父母之仇，不能报复，何以为人？十八年来，不识生身父母，至今日方知有母亲。此身若非师父捞救抚养，安有今日？容弟子去寻见母亲，然后头顶香盆，重建殿宇，报答师父之深恩也！”师父道：“你要去寻母，可带这血书与汗衫前去，只做化缘，径往江州私衙，才得你母亲相见。”\\n    玄奘领了师父言语，就做化缘的和尚，径至江州。适值刘洪有事出外，也是天教他母子相会，玄奘就直至私衙门口抄化。那殷小姐原来夜间得了一梦，梦见月缺再圆，暗想道：“我婆婆不知音信，我丈夫被这贼谋杀，我的儿子抛在江中，倘若有人收养，算来有十八岁矣，或今日天教相会，亦未可知。”正沉吟间，忽听私衙前有人念经，连叫“抄化”，小姐又乘便出来问道：“你是何处来的？”玄奘答道：“贫僧乃是金山寺法明长老的徒弟。”小姐道：“你既是金山寺长老的徒弟——”叫进衙来，将斋饭与玄奘吃。仔细看他举止言谈，好似与丈夫一般，小姐将从婢打发开去，问道：“你这小师父，还是自幼出家的？还是中年出家的？姓甚名谁？可有父母否？”玄奘答道：“我也不是自幼出家，我也不是中年出家，我说起来，冤有天来大，仇有海样深！我父被人谋死，我母亲被贼人占了。我师父法明长老教我在江州衙内寻取母亲。”小姐问道：“你母姓甚？”玄奘道：“我母姓殷名唤温娇，我父姓陈名光蕊，我小名叫做江流，法名取为玄奘。”小姐道：“温娇就是我。但你今有何凭据？”玄奘听说是他母亲，双膝跪下，哀哀大哭：“我娘若不信，见有血书汗衫为证！”温娇取过一看，果然是真，母子相抱而哭，就叫：“我儿快去！”玄奘道：“十八年不识生身父母，今朝才见母亲，教孩儿如何割舍？”小姐道：“我儿，你火速抽身前去！刘贼若回，他必害你性命！我明日假装一病，只说先年曾许舍百双僧鞋，来你寺中还愿。那时节，我有话与你说。”玄奘依言拜别。\\n    却说小姐自见儿子之后，心内一忧一喜，忽一日推病，茶饭不吃，卧于床上。刘洪归衙，问其原故，小姐道：“我幼时曾许下一愿，许舍僧鞋一百双。昨五日之前，梦见个和尚，手执利刃，要索僧鞋，便觉身子不快。”刘洪道：“这些小事，何不早说？”随升堂吩咐王左衙、李右衙：江州城内百姓，每家要办僧鞋一双，限五日内完纳。百姓俱依派完纳讫。小姐对刘洪道：\\n    “僧鞋做完，这里有甚么寺院，好去还愿？”刘洪道：“这江州有个金山寺、焦山寺，听你在那个寺里去。”小姐道：“久闻金山寺好个寺院，我就往金山寺去。”刘洪即唤王、李二衙办下船只。\\n    小姐带了心腹人，同上了船，稍水将船撑开，就投金山寺去。\\n    却说玄奘回寺，见法明长老，把前项说了一遍，长老甚喜。\\n    次日，只见一个丫鬟先到，说夫人来寺还愿，众僧都出寺迎接。\\n    小姐径进寺门，参了菩萨，大设斋衬，唤丫鬟将僧鞋暑袜，托于盘内。来到法堂，小姐复拈心香礼拜，就教法明长老分表与众僧去讫。玄奘见众僧散了，法堂上更无一人，他却近前跪下。小姐叫他脱了鞋袜看时，那左脚上果然少了一个小指头。当时两个又抱住而哭，拜谢长老养育之恩。法明道：“汝今母子相会，恐奸贼知之，可速速抽身回去，庶免其祸。”小姐道：“我儿，我与你一只香环，你径到洪州西北地方，约有一千五百里之程，那里有个万花店，当时留下婆婆张氏在那里，是你父亲生身之母。我再写一封书与你，径到唐王皇城之内，金殿左边，殷开山丞相家，是你母生身之父母。你将我的书递与外公，叫外公奏上唐王，统领人马，擒杀此贼，与父报仇，那时才救得老娘的身子出来。我今不敢久停，诚恐贼汉怪我归迟。”便出寺登舟而去。\\n    玄奘哭回寺中，告过师父，即时拜别，径往洪州。来到万花店，问那店主刘小二道：“昔年江州陈客官有一母亲住在你店中，如今好么？”刘小二道：“他原在我店中，后来昏了眼，三四年并无店租还我，如今在南门头一个破瓦窑里，每日上街叫化度日。那客官一去许久，到如今杳无信息，不知为何。”玄奘听罢，即时问到南门头破瓦窑，寻着婆婆。婆婆道：“你声音好似我儿陈光蕊。”玄奘道：“我不是陈光蕊，我是陈光蕊的儿子。温娇小姐是我的娘。”婆婆道：“你爹娘怎么不来？”玄奘道：“我爹爹被强盗打死了，我娘被强盗霸占为妻。”婆婆道：“你怎么晓得来寻我？”玄奘道：“是我娘着我来寻婆婆。我娘有书在此，又有香环一只。”那婆婆接了书并香环，放声痛哭道：“我儿为功名到此，我只道他背义忘恩，那知他被人谋死！且喜得皇天怜念，不绝我儿之后，今日还有孙子来寻我。”玄奘问：“婆婆的眼，如何都昏了？”婆婆道：“我因思量你父亲，终日悬望，不见他来，因此上哭得两眼都昏了。”玄奘便跪倒向天祷告道：“念玄奘一十八岁，父母之仇不能报复。今日领母命来寻婆婆，天若怜鉴弟子诚意，保我婆婆双眼复明！”祝罢，就将舌尖与婆婆舔眼。须臾之间，双眼舔开，仍复如初。婆婆觑了小和尚道：\\n    “你果是我的孙子！恰和我儿子光蕊形容无二！”婆婆又喜又悲。玄奘就领婆婆出了窑门，还到刘小二店内，将些房钱赁屋一间与婆婆栖身，又将盘缠与婆婆道：“我此去只月余就回。”\\n    随即辞了婆婆，径往京城。寻到皇城东街殷丞相府上，与门上人道：“小僧是亲戚，来探相公。”门上人禀知丞相，丞相道：“我与和尚并无亲眷。”夫人道：“我昨夜梦见我女儿满堂娇来家，莫不是女婿有书信回来也。”丞相便教请小和尚来到厅上。小和尚见了丞相与夫人，哭拜在地，就怀中取出一封书来，递与丞相。丞相拆开，从头读罢，放声痛哭。夫人问道：“相公，有何事故？”丞相道：“这和尚是我与你的外甥。女婿陈光蕊被贼谋死，满堂娇被贼强占为妻。”夫人听罢，亦痛哭不止。丞相道：“夫人休得烦恼，来朝奏知主上，亲自统兵，定要与女婿报仇。”\\n    次日，丞相入朝，启奏唐王曰：“今有臣婿状元陈光蕊，带领家小江州赴任，被稍水刘洪打死，占女为妻，假冒臣婿，为官多年，事属异变。乞陛下立发人马，剿除贼寇。”唐王见奏大怒，就发御林军六万，着殷丞相督兵前去。丞相领旨出朝，即往教场内点了兵，径往江州进发。晓行夜宿，星落鸟飞，不觉已到江州。殷丞相兵马，俱在北岸下了营寨。星夜令金牌下户唤到江州同知、州判二人，丞相对他说知此事，叫他提兵相助，一同过江而去。天尚未明，就把刘洪衙门围了。刘洪正在梦中，听得火炮一响，金鼓齐鸣，众兵杀进私衙，刘洪措手不及，早被擒住。丞相传下军令，将刘洪一干人犯，绑赴法场，令众军俱在城外安营去了。\\n    丞相直入衙内正厅坐下，请小姐出来相见。小姐欲待要出，羞见父亲，就要自缢。玄奘闻知，急急将母解救，双膝跪下，对母道：“儿与外公，统兵至此，与父报仇。今日贼已擒捉，母亲何故反要寻死？母亲若死，孩儿岂能存乎？”丞相亦进衙劝解。\\n    小姐道：“吾闻妇人从一而终。痛夫已被贼人所杀，岂可靦颜从贼？止因遗腹在身，只得忍耻偷生。今幸儿已长大，又见老父提兵报仇，为女儿者，有何面目相见！惟有一死以报丈夫耳！”\\n    丞相道：“此非我儿以盛衰改节，皆因出乎不得已，何得为耻！”\\n    父子相抱而哭，玄奘亦哀哀不止。丞相拭泪道：“你二人且休烦恼，我今已擒捉仇贼，且去发落去来。”即起身到法场，恰好江州同知亦差哨兵拿获水贼李彪解到。丞相大喜，就令军牢押过刘洪、李彪，每人痛打一百大棍，取了供状，招了先年不合谋死陈光蕊情由，先将李彪钉在木驴上，推去市曹，剐了千刀，枭首示众讫；把刘洪拿到洪江渡口先年打死陈光蕊处，丞相与小姐、玄奘，三人亲到江边，望空祭奠，活剜取刘洪心肝，祭了光蕊，烧了祭文一道。\\n    三人望江痛哭，早已惊动水府。有巡海夜叉，将祭文呈与龙王。龙王看罢，就差鳖无帅去请光蕊来到，道：“先生，恭喜！\\n    恭喜！今有先生夫人，公子同岳丈俱在江边祭你，我今送你还魂去也。再有如意珠一颗，走盘珠二颗，绞绡十端，明珠玉带一条奉送。你今日便可夫妻子母相会也。”光蕊再三拜谢。龙王就令夜叉将光蕊身尸送出江口还魂，夜叉领命而去。\\n    却说殷小姐哭奠丈夫一番，又欲将身赴水而死，慌得玄奘拚命扯住。正在仓皇之际，忽见水面上一个死尸浮来，靠近江岸之旁。小姐忙向前认看，认得是丈夫的尸首，一发嚎啕大哭不已。众人俱来观看，只见光蕊舒拳伸脚，身子渐渐展动，忽地爬将起来坐下，众人不胜惊骇。光蕊睁开眼，早见殷小姐与丈人殷丞相同着小和尚俱在身边啼哭。光蕊道：“你们为何在此？”小姐道：“因汝被贼人打死，后来妾身生下此子，幸遇金山寺长老抚养长大，寻我相会。我教他去寻外公，父亲得知，奏闻朝廷，统兵到此，拿住贼人。适才生取心肝，望空祭奠我夫，不知我夫怎生又得还魂。”光蕊道：“皆因我与你昔年在万花店时，买放了那尾金色鲤鱼，谁知那鲤鱼就是此处龙王。后来逆贼把我推在水中，全亏得他救我，方才又赐我还魂，送我宝物，俱在身上。更不想你生下这儿子，又得岳丈为我报仇。真是苦尽甘来，莫大之喜！”\\n    众官闻知，都来贺喜。丞相就令安排酒席，答谢所属官员，即日军马回程。来到万花店，那丞相传令安营。光蕊便同玄奘到刘家店寻婆婆。那婆婆当夜得了一梦，梦见枯木开花，屋后喜鹊频频喧噪，想道：“莫不是我孙儿来也？”说犹未了，只见店门外，光蕊父子齐到。小和尚指道：“这不是俺婆婆？”光蕊见了老母，连忙拜倒。母子抱头痛哭一场，把上项事说了一遍。算还了小二店钱，起程回到京城。进了相府，光蕊同小姐与婆婆、玄奘都来见了夫人。夫人不胜之喜，吩咐家僮，大排筵宴庆贺。\\n    丞相道：“今日此宴可取名为团圆会。”真正合家欢乐。\\n    次日早朝，唐王登殿，殷丞相出班，将前后事情备细启奏，并荐光蕊才可大用。唐王准奏，即命升陈萼为学士之职，随朝理政。玄奘立意安禅，送在洪福寺内修行。后来殷小姐毕竟从容自尽，玄奘自到金山寺中报答法明长老。不知后来事体若何，且听下回分解。\\n《》目录 第九回　袁守诚妙算无私曲　老龙王拙计犯天条\\n    诗曰：都城大国实堪观，八水周流绕四山。多少帝王兴此处，古来天下说长安。此单表陕西大国长安城，乃历代帝王建都之地。自周、秦、汉以来，三州花似锦，八水绕城流。三十六条花柳巷，七十二座管弦楼。华夷图上看，天下最为头，真是奇胜之方。今却是大唐太宗文皇帝登基，改元龙集贞观。此时已登极十三年，岁在己巳。且不说他驾前有安邦定国的英豪。与那创业争疆的杰士。\\n    却说长安城外泾河岸边，有两个贤人：一个是渔翁，名唤张稍；一个是樵子，名唤李定。他两个是不登科的进士，能识字的山人。一日，在长安城里，卖了肩上柴，货了篮中鲤，同入酒馆之中，吃了半酣，各携一瓶，顺泾河岸边，徐步而回。张稍道：\\n    “李兄，我想那争名的，因名丧体；夺利的，为利亡身；受爵的，抱虎而眠；承恩的，袖蛇而去。算起来，还不如我们水秀山青，逍遥自在，甘淡薄，随缘而过。”李定道：“张兄说得有理。但只是你那水秀，不如我的山青。”张稍道：“你山青不如我的水秀。\\n    有一《蝶恋花》词为证，词曰：烟波万里扁舟小，静依孤篷，西施声音绕。涤虑洗心名利少，闲攀蓼穗蒹葭草。数点沙鸥堪乐道，柳岸芦湾，妻子同欢笑。一觉安眠风浪俏，无荣无辱无烦恼。”\\n    李定道：“你的水秀，不如我的山青。也有个《蝶恋花》词为证，词曰：云林一段松花满，默听莺啼，巧舌如调管。红瘦绿肥春正暖，倏然夏至光阴转。又值秋来容易换，黄花香，堪供玩。迅速严冬如指拈，逍遥四季无人管。”渔翁道：“你山青不如我水秀，受用些好物，有一《鹧鸪天》为证，仙乡云水足生涯，摆橹横舟便是家。活剖鲜鳞烹绿鳖，旋蒸紫蟹煮红虾。青芦笋，水荇芽，菱角鸡头更可夸。娇藕老莲芹叶嫩，慈菇茭白鸟英花。”樵夫道：“你水秀不如我山青，受用些好物，亦有一《鹧鸪天》为证：\\n    崔巍峻岭接天涯，草舍茅庵是我家。腌腊鸡鹅强蟹鳖，獐豝兔鹿胜鱼虾。香椿叶，黄楝芽，竹笋山茶更可夸。紫李红桃梅杏熟，甜梨酸枣木樨花。”渔翁道：“你山青真个不如我的水秀，又有《天仙子》一首：一叶小舟随所寓，万迭烟波无恐惧。垂钩撒网捉鲜鳞，没酱腻，偏有味，老妻稚子团圆会。鱼多又货长安市，换得香醪吃个醉。蓑衣当被卧秋江，鼾鼾睡，无忧虑，不恋人间荣与贵。”樵子道：“你水秀还不如我的山青，也有《天仙子》一首：茆舍数椽山下盖，松竹梅兰真可爱。穿林越岭觅干柴，没人怪，从我卖，或少或多凭世界。将钱沽酒随心快，瓦钵磁瓯殊自在。酕醄醉了卧松阴，无挂碍，无利害，不管人间兴与败。”渔翁道：“李兄，你山中不如我水上生意快活，有一《西江月》为证：“红蓼花繁映月，黄芦叶乱摇风。碧天清远楚江空，牵搅一潭星动。入网大鱼作队，吞钩小鳜成丛。得来烹煮味偏浓，笑傲江湖打哄。”樵夫道：“张兄，你水上还不如我山中的生意快活，亦有《西江月》为证。败叶枯藤满路，破梢老竹盈山。女萝干葛乱牵攀，折取收绳杀担。虫蛀空心榆柳，风吹断头松楠。\\n    采来堆积备冬寒，换酒换钱从俺。”渔翁道：“你山中虽可比过，还不如我水秀的幽雅，有一《临江仙》为证：潮落旋移孤艇去，夜深罢棹歌来。蓑衣残月甚幽哉，宿鸥惊不起，天际彩云开。困卧芦洲无个事，三竿日上还捱。随心尽意自安排，朝臣寒待漏，争似我宽怀？”樵夫道：“你水秀的幽雅，还不如我山青更幽雅，亦有《临江仙》可证：苍径秋高拽斧去，晚凉抬担回来。野花插鬓更奇哉，拨云寻路出，待月叫门开。稚子山妻欣笑接，草床木枕敧捱。蒸梨炊黍旋铺排，瓮中新酿熟，真个壮幽怀！”渔翁道：\\n    “这都是我两个生意，赡身的勾当，你却没有我闲时节的好处，有诗为证，诗曰：闲看天边白鹤飞，停舟溪畔掩苍扉。倚篷教子搓钓线，罢棹同妻晒网围。性定果然知浪静，身安自是觉风微。\\n    绿蓑青笠随时着，胜挂朝中紫绶衣。”樵夫道：“你那闲时又不如我的闲时好也，亦有诗为证，诗曰：闲观缥缈白云飞，独坐茅庵掩竹扉。无事训儿开卷读，有时对客把棋围。喜来策杖歌芳径，兴到携琴上翠微。草履麻绦粗布被，心宽强似着罗衣。”\\n    张稍道：“李定，我两个真是微吟可相狎，不须檀板共金樽。但散道词章，不为稀罕，且各联几句，看我们渔樵攀话何如？”李定道：“张兄言之最妙，请兄先吟。”“舟停绿水烟波内，家住深山旷野中。偏爱溪桥春水涨，最怜岩岫晓云蒙。龙门鲜鲤时烹煮，虫蛀干柴日燎烘。钓网多般堪赡老，担绳二事可容终。小舟仰卧观飞雁，草径斜敧听唳鸿。口舌场中无我分，是非海内少吾踪。溪边挂晒缯如锦，石上重磨斧似锋。秋月晖晖常独钓，春山寂寂没人逢。鱼多换酒同妻饮，柴剩沽壶共子丛。\\n    自唱自斟随放荡，长歌长叹任颠风。呼兄唤弟邀船伙，挈友携朋聚野翁。行令猜拳频递盏，拆牌道字漫传钟。烹虾煮蟹朝朝乐，炒鸭爊鸡日日丰。愚妇煎茶情散诞，山妻造饭意从容。晓来举杖淘轻浪，日出担柴过大冲。雨后披蓑擒活鲤，风前弄斧伐枯松。潜踪避世妆痴蠢，隐姓埋名作哑聋。”张稍道：“李兄，我才僭先起句，今到我兄，也先起一联，小弟亦当续之。”“风月佯狂山野汉，江湖寄傲老余丁。清闲有分随潇洒，口舌无闻喜太平。月夜身眠茅屋稳，天昏体盖箬蓑轻。忘情结识松梅友，乐意相交鸥鹭盟。名利心头无算计，干戈耳畔不闻声。随时一酌香醪酒，度日三餐野菜羹。两束柴薪为活计，一竿钓线是营生。闲呼稚子磨钢斧，静唤憨儿补旧缯。春到爱观杨柳绿，时融喜看荻芦青。夏天避暑修新竹，六月乘凉摘嫩菱。霜降鸡肥常日宰，重阳蟹壮及时烹。冬来日上还沉睡，数九天高自不蒸。\\n    八节山中随放性，四时湖里任陶情。采薪自有仙家兴，垂钓全无世俗形。门外野花香艳艳，船头绿水浪平平。身安不说三公位，性定强如十里城。十里城高防阃令，三公位显听宣声。乐山乐水真是罕，谢天谢地谢神明。”他二人既各道词章，又相联诗句，行到那分路去处，躬身作别。张稍道：“李兄呵，途中保重！上山仔细看虎。假若有些凶险，正是明日街头少故人！”李定闻言，大怒道：“你这厮惫懒！好朋友也替得生死，你怎么咒我？我若遇虎遭害，你必遇浪翻江！”张稍道：“我永世也不得翻江。”李定道：“天有不测风云，人有暂时祸福。你怎么就保得无事？”张稍道：“李兄，你虽这等说，你还没捉摸；不若我的生意有捉摸，定不遭此等事。”李定道：“你那水面上营生，极凶极险，隐隐暗暗，有甚么捉摸？”张稍道：“你是不晓得。这长安城里，西门街上，有一个卖卦的先生。我每日送他一尾金色鲤，他就与我袖传一课，依方位，百下百着。今日我又去买卦，他教我在泾河湾头东边下网，西岸抛钓，定获满载鱼虾而归。明日上城来，卖钱沽酒，再与老兄相叙。”二人从此叙别。\\n    这正是路上说话，草里有人。原来这泾河水府有一个巡水的夜叉，听见了百下百着之言，急转水晶宫，慌忙报与龙王道：\\n    “祸事了！祸事了！”龙王问：“有甚祸事？”夜叉道：“臣巡水去到河边，只听得两个渔樵攀话。相别时，言语甚是利害。那渔翁说：长安城里西门街上，有个卖卦先生，算得最准。他每日送他鲤鱼一尾，他就袖传一课，教他百下百着。若依此等算准，却不将水族尽情打了？何以壮观水府，何以跃浪翻波辅助大王威力？”龙王甚怒，急提了剑就要上长安城，诛灭这卖卦的。旁边闪过龙子龙孙、虾臣蟹士、鲥军师鳜少卿鲤太宰，一齐启奏道：\\n    “大王且息怒。常言道，过耳之言，不可听信。大王此去，必有云从，必有雨助，恐惊了长安黎庶，上天见责。大王隐显莫测，变化无方，但只变一秀士，到长安城内，访问一番。果有此辈，容加诛灭不迟；若无此辈，可不是妄害他人也？”龙王依奏，遂弃宝剑，也不兴云雨，出岸上，摇身一变，变作一个白衣秀士，真个丰姿英伟，耸壑昂霄。步履端祥，循规蹈矩。语言遵孔孟，礼貌体周文。身穿玉色罗襕服，头戴逍遥一字巾。上路来拽开云步，径到长安城西门大街上。只见一簇人，挤挤杂杂，闹闹哄哄，内有高谈阔论的道：“属龙的本命，属虎的相冲。寅辰巳亥，虽称合局，但只怕的是日犯岁君。”龙王闻言，情知是那卖卜之处，走上前，分开众人，望里观看，只见：四壁珠玑，满堂绮绣。\\n    宝鸭香无断，磁瓶水恁清。两边罗列王维画，座上高悬鬼谷形。\\n    端溪砚，金烟墨，相衬着霜毫大笔；火珠林，郭璞数，谨对了台政新经。六爻熟谙，八卦精通。能知天地理，善晓鬼神情。一槃子午安排定，满腹星辰布列清。真个那未来事，过去事，观如月镜；几家兴，几家败，鉴若神明。知凶定吉，断死言生。开谈风雨迅，下笔鬼神惊。招牌有字书名姓，神课先生袁守诚。此人是谁？原来是当朝钦天监台正先生袁天罡的叔父，袁守诚是也。那先生果然相貌稀奇，仪容秀丽，名扬大国，术冠长安。龙王入门来，与先生相见。礼毕，请龙上坐，童子献茶。先生问曰：\\n    “公来问何事？”龙王曰：“请卜天上阴晴事如何。”先生即袖传一课，断曰：“云迷山顶，雾罩林梢。若占雨泽，准在明朝。”龙王曰：“明日甚时下雨？雨有多少尺寸？”先生道：“明日辰时布云，已时发雷，午时下雨，未时雨足，共得水三尺三寸零四十八点”。龙王笑曰：“此言不可作戏。如是明日有雨，依你断的时辰数目，我送课金五十两奉谢。若无雨，或不按时辰数目，我与你实说，定要打坏你的门面，扯碎你的招牌，即时赶出长安，不许在此惑众！”先生欣然而答：“这个一定任你。请了，请了，明朝雨后来会。”\\n    龙王辞别，出长安，回水府。大小水神接着，问曰：“大王访那卖卦的如何？”龙王道：“有，有，有！”但是一个掉嘴口讨春的先生。我问他几时下雨，他就说明日下雨；问他甚么时辰，甚么雨数，他就说辰时布云，已时发雷，午时下雨，未时雨足，得水三尺三寸零四十八点，我与他打了个赌赛；若果如他言，送他谢金五十两；如略差些，就打破他门面，赶他起身，不许在长安惑众。”众水族笑曰：“大王是八河都总管，司雨大龙神，有雨无雨，惟大王知之，他怎敢这等胡言？那卖卦的定是输了！定是输了！”\\n    此时龙子龙孙与那鱼鲫蟹士正欢笑谈此事未毕，只听得半空中叫：“泾河龙王接旨。”众抬头上看，是一个金衣力士，手擎玉帝敕旨，径投水府而来。慌得龙王整衣端肃，焚香接了旨。\\n    金衣力士回空而去。龙王谢恩，拆封看时，上写着：“敕命八河总，驱雷掣电行；明朝施雨泽，普济长安城。”旨意上时辰数目，与那先生判断者毫发不差，唬得那龙王魂飞魄散。少顷苏醒，对众水族曰：“尘世上有此灵人！真个是能通天彻地，却不输与他呵！”鲥军师奏云：“大王放心。要赢他有何难处？臣有小计，管教灭那厮的口嘴。”龙王问计，军师道：“行雨差了时辰，少些点数，就是那厮断卦不准，怕不赢他？那时捽碎招牌，赶他跑路，果何难也？”龙王依他所奏，果不担忧。\\n    至次日，点札风伯、雷公、云童、电母，直至长安城九霄空上。他挨到那巳时方布云，午时发雷，未时落雨，申时雨止，却只得三尺零四十点，改了他一个时辰，克了他三寸八点，雨后发放众将班师。他又按落云头，还变作白衣秀士，到那西门里大街上，撞入袁守诚卦铺，不容分说，就把他招牌、笔、砚等一齐捽碎。那先生坐在椅上，公然不动。这龙王又轮起门板便打、骂道：“这妄言祸福的妖人，擅惑众心的泼汉！你卦又不灵，言又狂谬！说今日下雨的时辰点数俱不相对，你还危然高坐，趁早去，饶你死罪！”守诚犹公然不惧分毫，仰面朝天冷笑道：“我不怕！我不怕！我无死罪，只怕你倒有个死罪哩！别人好瞒，只是难瞒我也。我认得你，你不是秀士，乃是泾河龙王。你违了玉帝敕旨，改了时辰，克了点数，犯了天条。你在那剐龙台上，恐难免一刀，你还在此骂我？”龙王见说，心惊胆战，毛骨悚然，急丢了门板，整衣伏礼，向先生跪下道：“先生休怪。前言戏之耳，岂知弄假成真，果然违犯天条，奈何？望先生救我一救！\\n    不然，我死也不放你。”守诚曰：“我救你不得，只是指条生路与你投生便了。”龙曰：“愿求指教。”先生曰：“你明日午时三刻，该赴人曹官魏征处听斩。你果要性命，须当急急去告当今唐太宗皇帝方好。那魏征是唐王驾下的丞相，若是讨他个人情，方保无事。”龙王闻言，拜辞含泪而去。不觉红日西沉，太阴星上，但见：烟凝山紫归鸦倦，远路行人投旅店。渡头新雁宿眭沙，银河现。催更筹，孤村灯火光无焰。风袅炉烟清道院，蝴蝶梦中人不见。月移花影上栏杆，星光乱。漏声换，不觉深沉夜已半。\\n    这泾河龙王也不回水府，只在空中，等到子时前后，收了云头，敛了雾角，径来皇宫门首。此时唐王正梦出宫门之外，步月花阴，忽然龙王变作人相，上前跪拜。口叫“陛下，救我！救我！”\\n    太宗云：“你是何人？朕当救你。”龙王云：“陛下是真龙，臣是业龙。臣因犯了天条，该陛下贤臣人曹官魏征处斩，故来拜求，望陛下救我一救！”太宗曰：“既是魏征处斩，朕可以救你。你放心前去。”龙王欢喜，叩谢而去。\\n    却说那太宗梦醒后，念念在心。早已至五鼓三点，太宗设朝，聚集两班文武官员。但见那：\\n    烟笼凤阙，香蔼龙楼。光摇丹扆动，云拂翠华流。君臣相契同尧舜，礼乐威严近汉周。侍臣灯，宫女扇，双双映彩；孔雀屏，麒麟殿，处处光浮。山呼万岁，华祝千秋。静鞭三下响，衣冠拜冕旒。宫花灿烂天香袭，堤柳轻柔御乐讴。珍珠帘，翡翠帘，金钩高控；龙凤扇，山河扇，宝辇停留。文官英秀，武将抖搜。御道分高下，丹墀列品流。金章紫绶乘三象，地久天长万万秋。众官朝贺已毕，各各分班。唐王闪凤目龙睛，一一从头观看，只见那文官内是房玄龄、杜如晦、徐世勣、许敬宗、王珪等，武官内是马三宝、段志贤、殷开山、程咬金、刘洪纪、胡敬德、秦叔宝等，一个个威仪端肃，却不见魏征丞相。唐王召徐世勣上殿道：“朕夜间得一怪梦，梦见一人迎面拜谒，口称是泾河龙王，犯了天条，该人曹官魏征处斩，拜告寡人救他，朕已许诺。今日班前独不见魏征，何也？”世勣对曰：“此梦告准，须臾魏征来朝，陛下不要放他出门。过此一日，可救梦中之龙。”唐王大喜，即传旨，着当驾官宣魏征入朝。\\n    却说魏征丞相在府，夜观乾象，正爇宝香，只闻得九霄鹤唳，却是天差仙使，捧玉帝金旨一道，着他午时三刻，梦斩泾河老龙。这丞相谢了天恩，斋戒沐浴，在府中试慧剑，运元神，故此不曾入朝。一见当驾官赍旨来宣，惶惧无任，又不敢违迟君命，只得急急整衣束带，同旨入朝，在御前叩头请罪。唐王出旨道：“赦卿无罪。”那时诸臣尚未退朝，至此，却命卷帘散朝，独留魏征，宣上金銮，召入便殿，先议论安邦之策，定国之谋。将近巳末午初时候，却命宫人取过大棋来，“朕与贤卿对弈一局。”众嫔妃随取棋枰，铺设御案。魏征谢了恩，即与唐王对弈。\\n    毕竟不知胜负如何，且听下回分解。"}},{"name":"scene","in":"formData","schema":{"description":"翻译模型","type":"string","required":false,"enumValueTitles":{"mt-plus":"专业版","mt-turbo":"轻量版"},"example":"mt-turbo"}},{"name":"ext","in":"formData","style":"json","schema":{"description":"控制翻译功能的扩展参数","type":"object","properties":{"examples":{"description":"翻译示例列表","type":"array","items":{"description":"翻译示例","type":"object","properties":{"tgt":{"description":"目标文本","type":"string","required":false,"example":"hello"},"src":{"description":"源文本","type":"string","required":false,"example":"你好"}},"required":false},"required":false},"domainHint":{"description":"领域提示（一段英文自然语言文本，用于指示大模型翻译的风格）","type":"string","required":false,"example":"this

Grinding bricks into mirrors, piling up snow for sustenance—how many youthful years have we thus lost in delusion? Swallowing the vast ocean with a hair, fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed—why do we still wear golden crowns and forced smiles? When enlightenment dawns, we transcend the ten stages and three vehicles; yet if we linger, we remain trapped within the four realms of existence and six paths. Who has heard, beneath the shadowless tree before the cliff of utter emptiness, the cuckoo’s cry heralding spring’s dawn? The Caosi trail is perilous, and the clouds over Jiling run deep; here, old friends’ voices fade away. On cliffs of thousand-zhang ice, five-petaled lotuses bloom, and incense curls from the ancient temple’s hanging curtains. At that moment, when we discern the source and stream, we shall behold the Dragon King’s Three Treasures.\\n\\nThis poem is titled \\\"Su Wu Slow.\\\" It tells of our Buddha, Shakyamuni, bidding farewell to the Jade Emperor and returning to the sacred abode of Leiyin. There, he found three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great vajras, and countless bodhisattvas, each holding banners, canopies, wondrous treasures, and celestial flowers, arrayed in the spiritual realm of Spirit Mountain beneath the twin banyan trees to greet him. Ascending upon auspicious clouds, Shakyamuni addressed the assembly: \\\"With profound wisdom, I have manifested throughout the three realms. The fundamental nature is ultimately tranquil and extinguished, identical to the void, devoid of all things. To subdue the rebellious monkey was no easy task; few could comprehend it. Birth and death begin with names, and phenomena are as they appear.\\\" Having spoken, he emitted rays of sarira light, filling the sky with forty-two radiant white rainbows stretching north and south. Upon seeing this, the crowd prostrated themselves in reverence. Soon after, auspicious clouds gathered, forming a lotus throne of supreme quality, upon which he sat serenely. The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight vajras, and four bodhisattvas approached, palms joined in prayer, and asked: \\\"Who was it that stirred up chaos in Heaven and disturbed the peach banquet?\\\" Shakyamuni replied: \\\"That fellow is a demonic monkey born on Flower Fruit Mountain, whose crimes are immeasurable and beyond description. Even the heavenly generals could not subdue him, though Erlang captured him. Even Laozi's fiery refining could not harm him. When I arrived, he was amidst the thunder gods, flaunting his might and spirit. I stopped the fighting, questioned him about his origins. He claimed supernatural powers, the ability to transform, and to ride the somersault cloud, covering one hundred and eight thousand li in a single leap. We made a wager: if he couldn't escape my grasp, I would seize him and imprison him under Five Elements Mountain. The Five Emperors opened their golden palaces and jade chambers, inviting me to take the chief seat and holding a grand assembly to honor me, after which I departed.\\\"\\n\\nThe crowd rejoiced upon hearing this, praising him profusely. After expressing gratitude, they dispersed into their respective groups, each resuming their duties and enjoying pure bliss. Indeed:\\n\\nAuspicious mists fill the land of India, rainbow light surrounds the honored one. In the West, he is called first—the formless Dharma King! Often we see mystical monkeys offering fruit, deer carrying flowers; green phoenixes dance, colorful phoenixes sing; sacred turtles present longevity, cranes capture medicinal herbs. Enjoying the Pure Land of Jetavana, partaking in the dragon palace's realm of Dharma. Flowers bloom daily, fruits ripen at every hour, cultivating tranquility and returning to truth, practicing Zen with genuine results. Neither annihilation nor birth, neither increase nor decrease. Mist and rosy clouds drift freely back and forth, unaffected by cold or heat, time itself forgotten.\\n\\nAs the poem says:\\nFree to come and go, carefree and at ease, free from fear and sorrow. In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, all is open and clear; in the great thousandfold world, there is neither spring nor autumn.\\n\\nOne day, while residing between the sacred mountain of Leiyin and the moonlit Spirit Mountain, the Buddha summoned all the Buddhas, Arhats, protectors, bodhisattvas, vajras, monks, nuns, and others, saying: \\\"Since subduing the rebellious monkey and pacifying Heaven, I have remained unaware of the passage of time, yet I estimate half a millennium has passed in the mortal realm, and now it is the full-moon day of early autumn. I possess a precious basin filled with a hundred varieties of flowers and a thousand kinds of exotic fruits, among other treasures. How shall we celebrate this 'Ullambana Festival' together with the Dharma?\\\" Each member of the assembly joined their palms, bowed three times before the Buddha, and understood his intention. Then, Shakyamuni instructed Ananda to carry the basin of flowers and fruits, while Ksitigarbha scattered offerings, filling the crowd with gratitude. Everyone offered poems in thanks.\\n\\nThe poem of blessings says:\\nBlessings shine brightly before the revered one, blessings embrace the depths and extend far and wide. Boundless virtue endures as long as the earth, blessed connections link us to heaven. Fields of blessing expand yearly, the sea of fortune grows deeper with each passing year. Blessings fill the universe, abundant shade and endless growth, ever complete and boundless.\\n\\nThe poem of prosperity says:\\nProsperity weighs as heavily as mountains, the colorful phoenix sings its song. Prosperity brings timely good fortune, like the evening star shining brightly. Adding ten thousand measures of wealth ensures health and well-being, enjoying a thousand vessels of peace. Salaries rival heaven, eternally secure, names as vast as the sea, ever clearer. Thoughts of prosperity inspire admiration, titles of honor spread glory across myriad nations.\\\\The longevity poem says:\\\\The star of longevity presents colorful offerings to the Buddha. From here, the realm of longevity shines with splendor. Plates brimming with fruits of longevity emit auspicious radiance, and freshly picked flowers of longevity adorn the lotus pedestal. The poems of longevity are elegant and full of wonders, while the melodies of longevity harmonize beautifully with talented voices. Longevity extends as long as the sun and moon, and may it be as vast and serene as mountains and seas.\\\\After all the Bodhisattvas finished their offerings, they respectfully requested the Buddha to clearly explain the fundamental principles and trace the origins. The Buddha slightly opened his compassionate mouth, expounded the great Dharma, and proclaimed the true fruit, lecturing on the profound scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the perfection of the Five Skandhas. At that moment, heavenly dragons circled around, and flowers rained down in profusion. Indeed: \\\"The Zen mind brightly illuminates the moon over a thousand rivers, and true nature embraces the vastness of ten thousand miles of sky.\\\" After finishing his lecture, the Buddha addressed the assembly: \\\"In the four great continents I now manifest, sentient beings differ in goodness and evil from place to place. In the Eastern Continent of Jambudvipa, people revere heaven and earth, with clear minds and calm spirits. In the Northern Continent of Uttarakuru, though fond of their own kin, they merely struggle for survival, possessing simple natures and limited aspirations, rarely indulging in excess. In the Western Continent of Aparagodaniya, people neither covet nor kill, nurturing their qi and cultivating inner spirit; though lacking supreme truth, everyone enjoys a long life. But in the Southern Continent of Kalirupa, greed, lust, and delight in misfortune prevail, with much killing and strife—truly a battlefield of tongues and a sea of slander and evil. Now I have the Tripitaka scriptures, which can persuade people to do good.\\\"\\\\Upon hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas clasped their hands in reverence and approached the Buddha, asking: \\\"What are the three collections of the Tripitaka scriptures?\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\"I have one collection of Dharma, discussing heaven; one collection of Vinaya, speaking of earth; and one collection of Sutra, guiding ghosts. Together, these three collections comprise thirty-five volumes, totaling 15,144 scrolls, representing the path to cultivation and the gateway to righteousness. I intend to send them to the Eastern Land, but alas, the beings there are foolish, slandering the true words and failing to understand the essence of my teachings, neglecting the authentic Yoga tradition. How can we find someone powerful enough to journey to the Eastern Land, seek out a sincere believer, guide him through hardships across thousands of mountains and distant waters, bring him to me to obtain the true scriptures, and perpetually spread them in the Eastern Land? This would indeed be a blessing as vast as mountains and a fortune as deep as the sea. Who would be willing to undertake such a journey?\\\" At this point, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva stepped forward to the lotus pedestal, bowed three times before the Buddha, and said: \\\"Your disciple, though unworthy, is willing to go to the Eastern Land and find someone to retrieve the scriptures.\\\" All present looked up at the Bodhisattva:\\\\Perfect in virtue and wisdom, his golden body is filled with intelligence. Beaded garlands hang gracefully, fragrant rings gleam with precious light, dark clouds cleverly form coiled dragons, and embroidered ribbons gently flutter like colorful phoenix feathers. A jade clasp adorns his plain silk robe, surrounded by auspicious radiance; a brocade skirt and golden cords bring forth auspicious energy. His brows resemble crescent moons, his eyes like twin stars. Five faces naturally express joy, and his vermilion lips are touched with a hint of red. The vase of pure nectar overflows year after year, and the willow branch inserted askew remains ever green. He resolves eight difficulties and saves countless beings with great compassion; thus he dwells atop great mountains, resides in the South Sea, rescues those in suffering by responding to their cries, universally praised and answered, revered by thousands of saints and spirits. His heart delights in purple bamboo, and his nature cherishes fragrant vines. He is the compassionate lord of Mount Luojia, the living Avalokiteshvara in the Cave of Tidal Sounds.\\\\Seeing this, the Buddha was overjoyed and said: \\\"No one else can go; only the venerable Avalokiteshvara, with his vast supernatural powers, is capable of undertaking this mission.\\\" The Bodhisattva asked: \\\"If I go to the Eastern Land, do you have any instructions for me?\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\"On this journey, you must carefully examine the roads, not traveling through the heavens, but rather among clouds and mists. As you pass mountains and rivers, remember the distances and details of the route, and give careful guidance to the scripture seeker. Fearing that the sincere believer may find the journey difficult, I shall provide you with five treasures.\\\" Then he ordered Ananda and Kashyapa to bring forth a \\\"brocade kasaya robe\\\" and a \\\"nine-ringed staff,\\\" handing them to the Bodhisattva and saying: \\\"This robe and staff can be personally used by the scripture seeker. If he comes here with firm resolve, wearing my robe will prevent him from falling into reincarnation, and holding my staff will protect him from harm.\\\" \\\\The Bodhisattva received these items with reverence, and the Buddha then took three headbands and handed them to the Bodhisattva, saying: \\\"These treasures are called 'tightening bands.' Though there are three identical ones, each is used differently. I have three incantations of 'Golden Tightening Seal.' If on the road you encounter powerful demons, you must persuade them to reform and become disciples of the scripture seeker. If they refuse to obey, you may place this band on their head, and it will naturally take root in their flesh. By reciting the appropriate incantation, their eyes will swell, their head will ache, and their foreheads will split open, forcing them to enter my fold.\\\"Upon hearing these words, the Bodhisattva joyfully bowed and stepped back, immediately summoning Huai'an the Pilgrim to accompany him. Huai'an wielded a solid iron staff weighing a thousand jin, serving as a mighty demon-slaying warrior at the Bodhisattva's side. The Bodhisattva then wrapped the Mirror Lake Robe into a bundle and instructed Huai'an to carry it on his back. Concealing the golden ring, the Bodhisattva took up his copper clapper and set off directly down from Spirit Mountain. This journey would bring about a significant outcome: the Buddha's disciple would return to fulfill his original vow, and Elder Golden Cicada would wrap himself in sandalwood robes.\\n\\nWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain, he was greeted by the Great Immortal of the Golden Summit at Yuzhen Temple, who stood at the temple gate to offer tea. The Bodhisattva dared not linger long and said to the Great Immortal, \\\"I have received the Buddha's command to travel eastward to seek out the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures.\\\" The Great Immortal asked, \\\"When will this pilgrim arrive?\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\"It is uncertain—perhaps within two or three years, or possibly sooner.\\\" With that, he bade farewell to the Great Immortal, traveling through clouds and mist, carefully noting the route along the way. A poem bears witness to this journey:\\n\\n\\\"Seeking across ten thousand miles without a word,\\nWho can claim complete success when desire remains unfulfilled?\\nTo seek others seems so effortless—\\nIs this not fate, destined for me all my life?\\nThe Way is taught with methods, yet without faith, even truth becomes empty rumor.\\nI pledge my heart and soul to find companionship;\\nI know surely ahead lies an encounter meant by destiny.\\\"\\n\\nAs master and disciple continued their journey, they suddenly came upon the Weak Water River, a vast expanse marking the boundary of the Quicksand River. The Bodhisattva remarked:\\n\\n\\\"My disciple, this place proves truly difficult to traverse. How could a mortal with impure flesh and blood possibly cross over?\\\" Huai'an asked, \\\"Master, how far does this river stretch?\\\" As the Bodhisattva paused to gaze, he saw:\\n\\n\\\"To the east it connects with sandy deserts, reaching both eastern and western lands; to the south it extends to Ugo, and to the north it leads to the Tartars. Eight hundred li lie along its length, while its breadth stretches for countless miles. The water flows like the earth turning over, and the waves surge like mountains rising on their backs. Vast and boundless, desolate and endless, its roar echoes for ten li, and its floodwaters rise ten thousand feet high. Even celestial rafts cannot reach here, nor can lotus leaves float upon its surface. Withered grasses bend beneath the slanting sun, yellow clouds obscure the long embankments. Who among merchants dares to travel here? Where do fishermen find shelter? On the flat sands no geese alight, and from distant shores come the cries of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know the beauty of this scene, and the delicate fragrance of white duckweed lingers faintly.\\\"\\n\\nAs the Bodhisattva surveyed the area, a loud splash erupted from the river, and a hideous demon leaped forth from the waters. Its appearance was truly monstrous:\\n\\nIts skin neither green nor black, but dull and gloomy; its body neither tall nor short, barefoot and sinewy. Its eyes gleamed like twin lamps at the hearth, its mouth forked like a butcher's cleaver. Fangs protruded like blades, and fiery hair stood disheveled. It roared like thunder, and its feet moved swiftly as if driven by a rolling wind.\\n\\nThe monster brandished a magical staff and rushed ashore, attempting to seize the Bodhisattva. But Huai'an blocked him with his solid iron club, shouting, \\\"Halt!\\\" The monster raised his staff in response, and the two clashed by the Quicksand River. This fierce battle was truly astonishing:\\n\\nMu Zha's iron club protected the righteous path, displaying divine power; the monster's demon-slaying staff fought valiantly. Two silver serpents danced along the riverbank, and two divine beings charged toward the shore. One wielded might over the Quicksand, demonstrating extraordinary skill; the other defended Guanyin, earning great merit. One leapt and splashed through the waves, while the other spewed mist and clouds. Waves and surges darkened the heavens, mist and clouds dimmed the sun and moon. That demon-slaying staff resembled a white tiger emerging from the mountains; this solid iron club was like a yellow dragon lying in wait. One advanced, parting snakes and stirring grass; the other swung wide, scattering hawks and splitting pines. The battle raged until darkness enveloped everything, stars shone brightly, and mist swirled, blurring heaven and earth. That one had long dwelled in the Weak Water, fierce and relentless; this one achieved his first great feat since leaving Spirit Mountain.\\n\\nThe two fought back and forth for dozens of rounds, evenly matched, with no clear victor. Finally, the monster blocked Mu Zha's iron club and demanded, \\\"Who are you, monk, to dare confront me?\\\" Mu Zha replied, \\\"I am Mu Zha, the Second Prince of the Heavenly King Tota, known as Huai'an the Pilgrim. I now accompany my master on a journey to the Eastern Lands to seek the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures. Who are you, demon, to boldly block our path?\\\" The monster suddenly realized, \\\"I remember you practicing alongside Guanyin of the South Sea in the Bamboo Grove! Why have you come here?\\\" Mu Zha answered, \\\"Isn't that Master standing on the shore?\\\"\\n\\nHearing this, the monster stammered repeatedly, lowered his magical staff, and allowed Mu Zha to lead him before Guanyin. Prostrating himself, he pleaded, \\\"Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and listen to my confession. I am no evil spirit—I am the Scroll-Raising General, an attendant to the imperial carriage in the Celestial Palace.\\\"It was only because I accidentally broke a glass cup during the cricket peach banquet that the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes and banished me to the mortal realm, transforming me into this wretched form. Moreover, every seven days, he commands flying swords to pierce my chest and sides more than a hundred times before withdrawing. Thus, I suffer such torment. With no other choice, driven by unbearable hunger and cold, every two or three days I venture out into the waves to seek passersby for sustenance. Little did I expect today, through ignorance, to have offended the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva. \\n\\nThe Bodhisattva said, \\\"You were guilty in Heaven, and now that you've been cast down, you continue to harm living beings—truly, sin upon sin. I have received Buddha's decree to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. Why don't you join my path, embrace virtuous fruit, become a disciple of that pilgrim, and accompany him westward to pay homage to the Buddha and obtain the sacred texts? Then I shall ensure the flying swords no longer pierce you. Once your mission is accomplished, you'll be absolved of guilt and restored to your original position. What say you?\\\"\\n\\nThe monster replied, \\\"I am willing to embrace the righteous path.\\\" Stepping forward, he said, \\\"Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless humans here, and several pilgrims have passed by, all of whom I've consumed. Every time I ate someone, I tossed their head into the quicksand, where it sank straight to the bottom (a water so deep even goose feathers cannot float). Yet nine pilgrims' skulls floated on the surface, refusing to sink. Thinking them strange objects, I strung them together with a rope and kept them for amusement during idle moments. But now, if the pilgrims never reach this place, wouldn't that only hinder my own future prospects?\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\"How could they possibly fail to arrive? You may hang those skulls above your head as a reminder, waiting patiently for the pilgrims; they will surely prove useful.\\\" The monster said, \\\"If that's the case, I gladly accept your guidance.\\\" The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred the precepts upon him, designated sand as his surname, and thus he became known as Sha Wujing. From that moment, he entered the monastic order, helped the Bodhisattva cross the river, purified his heart and mind, resolved never again to harm living beings, and dedicated himself solely to awaiting the pilgrim.\\n\\nAfter bidding farewell to the monster, the Bodhisattva and Muzha set off directly toward the Eastern lands. After traveling for some time, they came upon another towering mountain shrouded in malevolent energy, making it impossible to climb. Just as they prepared to ride the clouds over the mountain, a sudden gust of wind arose, and another demon appeared. This demon was truly fearsome:\\n\\nHis lips curled upward like lotus petals, his ears resembled giant fans, and his golden eyes gleamed fiercely. His tusks were sharp as steel files, and his gaping mouth seemed like a blazing brazier. A golden helmet tightly secured his cheeks, and armored scales adorned his body like a retreating python. In one hand, he wielded a spiked club resembling a dragon's claw, while a crescent-shaped bow hung from his waist, its ten arrows gleaming brightly. His imposing presence intimidated even the fiercest spirits, and his soaring ambition dwarfed the might of celestial gods. Without hesitation, he charged forward, aiming his spiked club at the Bodhisattva. But Muzha stepped in to block the attack, shouting loudly, \\\"You vile monster, how dare you behave so rudely! Take this!\\\" The demon retorted, \\\"This monk doesn't know when to die! Here's my pitchfork!\\\" And so, beneath the mountain, the two clashed fiercely, battling to decide the victor. It was a truly fierce fight:\\n\\nThe demon was ferocious, yet Hui'an possessed great power. Iron clubs split hearts, and spiked drills met faces head-on. Dust and dirt filled the air, darkening heaven and earth, while flying rocks and debris startled ghosts and gods. The nine-pronged pitchfork gleamed brilliantly, its double rings ringing clearly; the iron staff was sleek and black, soaring through both hands. One was the prince of the Heavenly King, the other a valiant general spirit. One protected the law on Mount Putuo, the other dwelled as a demon in a cave. In this encounter, neither knew who would lose nor who would win.\\n\\nJust as the two were locked in battle, Guanyin appeared in mid-air, tossing down a lotus flower to separate the pitchfork and staff. Startled, the monster asked, \\\"Who are you, monk, daring to play tricks like 'flowers before my eyes' to deceive me?\\\" Muzha replied, \\\"You mere mortal with fleshly eyes! I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. This lotus flower was thrown by my master—you can't even recognize it!\\\" The monster exclaimed, \\\"The Bodhisattva of the South Sea—is that Guanyin, who sweeps away three calamities and rescues from eight tribulations?\\\" Muzha answered, \\\"Who else could it be?\\\" The monster dropped his spiked club, bowed deeply, and said, \\\"Brother, where is the Bodhisattva? Please trouble yourself to introduce me.\\\"\\n\\nMuzha pointed upward and said, \\\"Isn't it right there?\\\" The monster bowed repeatedly toward the sky, crying out loudly, \\\"Bodhisattva, forgive me! Forgive me!\\\"\\n\\nGuanyin descended from the clouds and approached, asking, \\\"What kind of wild boar transformed into a spirit are you, what sort of old pig wreaks havoc here, daring to block my way?\\\" The monster replied, \\\"I am neither a wild boar nor an old pig—I was originally Tianpeng, the Marshal of the Heavenly River.\\\"It was only because I teased Chang'e while drunk that the Jade Emperor struck me with two thousand hammer blows and banished me to the mortal realm. My true spirit, in a misguided attempt at rebirth, mistakenly entered the womb of a sow, resulting in this monstrous form. I bit and killed the sow, slaughtered the entire herd of pigs, and seized this mountain territory, surviving by preying on humans. Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered you, Bodhisattva—please, I beg you, save me! Tassa asked, “What is the name of this mountain?” The monster replied, “It’s called Mount Fuleng. Within the mountain lies a cave known as Yunzhan Cave. Originally, there lived a woman named Egg Sister Two inside that cave. Seeing that I had some martial skills, she made me the head of the household and even nicknamed me ‘Inverted Gate.’ But less than a year later, she died, leaving all her possessions to me. Now, after living here for so long, I have no meaningful occupation.” The Bodhisattva said, “As the ancients taught: ‘If you wish for a future, avoid actions that lead to none.’ You broke the laws of Heaven above, yet still refuse to abandon your violent nature, harming living beings and creating karma. Isn’t that committing two offenses at once?” The monster retorted, “A future? A future! If I followed your advice, I’d be left to starve! As the saying goes: ‘Obeying official law means being beaten to death; obeying Buddhist law means starving to death.’ Go away! Go away! It’s better to catch a traveler and feast on his fatty flesh! Who cares about two sins, three sins, a thousand sins, ten thousand sins!” The Bodhisattva replied, “‘Heaven responds to sincere human wishes.’ If you’re willing to turn to the righteous path, there will surely be a place for you to sustain yourself. The world has five grains; they can all satisfy hunger—why must you survive by eating people?” Upon hearing this, the monster seemed to awaken from a dream and said to the Bodhisattva, “I want to follow the right path, but how can I when ‘to offend Heaven leaves no prayer unanswered’?” The Bodhisattva continued, “I’ve received Buddha’s command to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. You could become his disciple and accompany him on a journey westward, redeeming your sins through merit, and I’ll ensure you escape this calamity.” The monster eagerly agreed, exclaiming, “I’m willing! I’m willing!” The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred upon him the precepts, assigned him the surname Zhu (Pig), gave him the Dharma name Zhu Wuneng, and instructed him to observe vegetarian vows, renouncing the five pungent vegetables and the three forbidden meats, patiently awaiting the arrival of the pilgrim. After parting ways with Mutza, the Bodhisattva and Mutza rose into the clouds, traveling onward, when suddenly they saw a jade dragon crying out in mid-air. Approaching it, the Bodhisattva asked, “Who are you, dragon, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon replied, “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I set fire to the luminous pearl in the palace, my father reported me to Heaven, accusing me of rebellion. The Five Emperors hung me in mid-air and beat me three hundred times, and soon I’ll be executed. Please, Bodhisattva, save me!” Hearing this, Guanyin immediately rushed with Mutza toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. There, the two celestial masters, Qiu and Zhang, greeted them and asked, “Where are you headed?” The Bodhisattva replied, “This humble monk wishes to see the Jade Emperor.” The two masters quickly reported the request, and the Jade Emperor descended from his throne to welcome them. After paying respects, the Bodhisattva said, “I’ve been sent by Buddha to seek the pilgrim in the Eastern Lands. On my way, I encountered a wicked dragon hanging here, and I’ve come specifically to petition for mercy, asking that his life be spared and entrusted to me, so he may serve as a mount for the pilgrim.” Upon hearing this, the Five Emperors immediately issued an edict of pardon, ordering a heavenly general to release the dragon and deliver him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva expressed gratitude and departed. The little dragon prostrated himself, thanking the Bodhisattva for saving his life, and pledged obedience to her commands. The Bodhisattva placed him deep in a ravine, where he would wait for the pilgrim to arrive, transforming into a white horse and earning merit in the West. The little dragon accepted the order and quietly disappeared. Leading Mutza, the Bodhisattva continued her journey across this mountain and onward toward the Eastern Lands. Not long after, they suddenly saw countless golden rays of light and auspicious vapors rising in thousands of streams. Mutza exclaimed, “Master, that shining place must be the Five Elements Mountain, where the Buddha’s ‘seal’ is affixed!” The Bodhisattva confirmed, “Indeed, that’s the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who once disrupted the Peach Banquet and caused chaos in the Heavenly Palace—he now lies imprisoned beneath this seal.” Mutza agreed, “Exactly, exactly!” Master and disciple climbed the mountain together and gazed upon the inscription, which read the six-syllable mantra: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” After examining it, the Bodhisattva sighed deeply and composed a poem, which reads:  \\nHow pitiful that the mischievous monkey defied authority,  \\nOnce reckless and bold, flaunting heroic might.  \\nDeceitful, he disrupted the Peach Banquet,  \\nDaringly intruded upon the Tuishou Palace.  \\nUnrivaled among ten thousand soldiers,  \\nHis might resounded through the nine heavens.  \\nNow trapped by our Buddha Shakyamuni,  \\nWhen will he stretch forth again and display his glory?  \\nWhile master and disciple were speaking, the Great Sage was already alerted.Da Sheng stood at the foot of the mountain and shouted loudly,  \\n“Who is it up there on the hill, reciting poetry and exposing my flaws?”  \\nUpon hearing this, the Bodhisattva immediately descended the mountain to investigate. Below the rocky cliff, they found the local deity, the mountain god, and the celestial generals who had been guarding the Great Sage—all coming forward to greet the Bodhisattva and escort them before the Great Sage himself. When they looked closely, they saw that he was trapped inside a stone casket, able to speak but unable to move. The Bodhisattva asked, “Hey you with the surname Sun, do you recognize me?”  \\nThe Great Sage opened his fiery golden eyes, nodded vigorously, and cried out, “How could I not know you? You are indeed the compassionate and merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo in the South Sea, who saves those in distress and hardship. Thank you for your kindness! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been spending each day here like an eternity, with not a single acquaintance to visit me. But pray tell, where have you come from?”  \\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “I was sent by the Buddha’s decree to journey eastward in search of someone to retrieve scriptures. Passing by here, I paused briefly to check on you.”  \\nThe Great Sage said, “The Buddha deceived me, trapping me beneath this mountain for over five hundred years, unable to break free. I earnestly beg you, great Bodhisattva, to show me some mercy and rescue old Sun once and for all!”  \\nThe Bodhisattva responded, “Your sins run deep. If I were to free you now, I fear you’d only cause more trouble—such an outcome would hardly be commendable.”  \\nThe Great Sage insisted, “I’ve already repented deeply. Please, great compassionate one, point me toward a path of redemption, and I’ll willingly devote myself to cultivation.”  \\nAnd so it came to pass:  \\n“A single thought arises in the human heart, and heaven and earth take note. If good and evil remain unpunished, surely heaven and earth must harbor bias.”  \\nHearing these words, the Bodhisattva felt immense joy and said to the Great Sage, “As the scriptures say: ‘Speak kindly, and distant lands will respond; speak unkindly, and distant lands will recoil.’ Since you’ve shown such sincerity, when I reach the Tang Empire in the East, I’ll find someone tasked with retrieving scriptures and instruct him to rescue you. You can become his disciple, uphold the teachings, and enter the Buddhist fold. Then we can work together toward enlightenment. What do you say?”  \\nThe Great Sage exclaimed loudly, “I accept! I accept!”  \\nThe Bodhisattva continued, “Since you’ve shown such virtue, let me give you a Dharma name.”  \\nThe Great Sage replied, “I already have a name—I’m called Sun Wukong.”  \\nThe Bodhisattva happily added, “Two others have previously taken refuge under the character ‘Wu’—you too shall bear that character, perfectly aligning with them. How wonderful, how wonderful! There’s no need for further reminders; I shall depart now.”  \\nThus, the Great Sage, having realized his true nature, returned wholeheartedly to Buddhism, while the Bodhisattva lingered, mindful of her divine mission.  \\nTogether with Mutzha, they set off eastward, arriving without delay in Chang’an, the capital of the Tang Empire. As mist cleared and clouds dispersed, master and disciple transformed into two ragged, leprous monks, entering the city of Chang’an unnoticed, unaware that evening had already fallen. Walking along the main market street, they spotted a local deity shrine and stepped right inside, startling the local deity and sending the ghostly soldiers into trembling fear. Realizing it was the Bodhisattva, the deity quickly prostrated himself in reverence. Hastily, the local deity ran to inform the City God, the district magistrate, and all the deities of every temple throughout Chang’an, who promptly gathered to pay their respects, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our tardiness in welcoming you.”  \\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “You must not reveal this news. I’ve come here specifically by the Buddha’s command to seek out someone who will retrieve scriptures. I’ll temporarily stay in your temple for a few days, until I find the true monk, then I’ll return.”  \\nAll the deities returned to their respective posts, and the local deity was hurriedly relocated to the City God’s temple for temporary residence, while the master and disciple concealed their true forms.  \\nFor now, we don’t yet know whether they’ll succeed in finding the scripture seeker. Tune in next time to find out.  \\nTable of Contents, Appendix: Chen Guangrui Sets Off for Office and Encounters Disaster; Jiangliu Monk Takes Revenge to Restore His Roots.  \\nNow, let us speak of Chang’an, the great capital of Shaanxi Province, a city built as the imperial seat by emperors of past dynasties. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han eras, the three districts have blossomed like brocade, and eight rivers flow around the city, truly making it a land of scenic wonders. At this time, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Zhenguan, and had already reigned for thirteen years, in the year of Ji Si. The realm enjoyed peace, tribute flowed in from all directions, and the four seas acknowledged his sovereignty. One day, Emperor Taizong convened all civil and military officials, and after the morning ceremony concluded, Prime Minister Wei Zheng stepped forward and reported, “Today the realm is peaceful, and tranquility prevails in all directions. In accordance with ancient custom, we should open examination halls, recruit talented individuals, and promote capable people to serve in governance.”  \\nEmperor Taizong said,  \\n“What you propose, esteemed minister, is entirely reasonable.”  \\nAnd so he issued a notice calling for talented scholars, proclaiming throughout the empire: all prefectures, provinces, and counties, regardless of whether they were military or civilian, anyone among the literati who possessed clear understanding of classical texts and excelled in the three examinations, should travel to Chang’an to take the test.When the imperial edict reached the region of Haizhou, a man named Chen Guangrui, with the courtesy name E, saw it and immediately returned home. He said to his mother, Lady Zhang, \\\"The court has issued a yellow proclamation, calling for talented individuals from southern provinces to take the examinations. I intend to go and compete. If I can secure even a minor official post, it will bring honor and fame to my family, ensure prosperity for my wife and children, and bring glory to our household—this is my greatest ambition. I am informing you of my decision before I depart.\\\" Lady Zhang replied, \\\"My son, as a scholar, you should indeed 'study in youth and act in adulthood.' That is exactly how it should be. But when you go to take the exams, you must be careful along the way, and once you obtain an official position, return home promptly.\\\" Guangrui then instructed his servants to pack his belongings, bid farewell to his mother, and set off on his journey without delay. Upon arriving in Chang'an, he found that the examination grounds were already open, so he entered the competition. After passing the preliminary tests and successfully completing the three policy essays in the imperial court examination, Emperor Tang personally bestowed upon him the title of zhuangyuan (top scholar) and awarded him a horse to ride through the streets for three days. Unexpectedly, during his parade, he passed by the residence of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, whose only daughter, Wen Jiao, also known as Mantang Jiao, had not yet married. She was standing atop a beautifully decorated pavilion, tossing a silk ball to select her husband. As Chen Guangrui happened to pass below, the young lady caught sight of his outstanding appearance and recognized him as the newly crowned zhuangyuan. Overjoyed, she threw down the silk ball, which landed squarely on Guangrui's black official cap. Suddenly, a gentle melody of flutes and strings filled the air, and more than ten maids descended from the pavilion, leading Guangrui's horse and escorting him into the prime minister's mansion to celebrate their wedding. The prime minister and his wife immediately came out to greet the guests, officiated the ceremony, and formally betrothed the young lady to Guangrui. They bowed to heaven and earth, exchanged vows as husband and wife, and paid respects to the bride's parents. The prime minister then ordered a banquet to be prepared, and they celebrated joyfully throughout the night.\\n\\nThe two held hands tenderly as they entered the bridal chamber. The next morning, at the third watch of the day, Emperor Taizong took his seat in the Golden Hall, surrounded by civil and military officials who had gathered for court. Taizong asked, \\\"What official position should be granted to the newly appointed zhuangyuan, Chen Guangrui?\\\" Prime Minister Wei Zheng replied, \\\"Your servant has examined the available vacancies in various prefectures and counties and found that Jiangzhou currently has an unoccupied post. I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint him to this position.\\\" Taizong immediately agreed and appointed Guangrui as governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to prepare for departure without delay. Guangrui expressed his gratitude, left the palace, returned to the prime minister's residence, discussed the matter with his wife, bid farewell to his in-laws, and set off with his wife toward Jiangzhou to assume his new post.\\n\\nAs they left Chang'an, the weather was late spring, with gentle breezes turning the willows green and fine rain sprinkling red blossoms. Upon arriving home, Guangrui and his wife paid their respects to Lady Zhang. Lady Zhang said, \\\"Congratulations, my son! You've not only succeeded in the examinations but have also brought your bride home.\\\" Guangrui replied, \\\"It is entirely due to your blessings, Mother, that I was fortunate enough to become zhuangyuan, received the imperial procession through the streets, and encountered the silk ball toss in front of Prime Minister Yin's residence, where I was chosen as his daughter's husband. Now the court has appointed me governor of Jiangzhou, and I have come to fetch you so we may all travel together to take up my post.\\\" Lady Zhang was overjoyed and began preparing for the journey. After several days on the road, they arrived at Liu Xiao'er's inn near Wanhuadian. Suddenly, Lady Zhang fell ill, and she said to Guangrui, \\\"I'm feeling unwell. Let's rest here for two days to recover before continuing.\\\" Guangrui obeyed her wishes. The following morning, he noticed a man selling a golden carp outside the inn. Guangrui bought it for one guan, intending to cook it for his mother. But as he looked closer, he saw that the fish blinked its eyes mysteriously. Astonished, Guangrui exclaimed, \\\"I've heard that fish and snakes blink their eyes—it surely can't be an ordinary creature!\\\" He then asked the fisherman, \\\"Where did you catch this fish?\\\" The fisherman replied, \\\"Fifteen li from the city, in the Hongjiang River.\\\" Guangrui immediately released the fish back into the river. Returning to the inn, he told his mother about it, and she said, \\\"Releasing living creatures is a virtuous deed, and I'm very pleased.\\\" Guangrui added, \\\"We've already stayed here for three days, and time is pressing. I plan to leave tomorrow, but I wonder if you're well enough to travel?\\\" Lady Zhang answered, \\\"I'm not feeling well, and the heat along the road might worsen my condition. Why don't you rent a house here temporarily while I stay behind? Leave some money with me, and you two can go ahead to take up your post. I'll join you when the autumn coolness arrives.\\\" Guangrui consulted with his wife, rented a house, gave his mother some funds, and bid them both farewell.\\n\\nThe journey was arduous, with days of travel and nights spent in lodging, and soon they reached the Hongjiang ferry crossing. There, they found Liu Hong and Li Biao waiting to guide them across the river. It seemed that Guangrui's past karma had destined him to encounter these ill-fated individuals.Guangrui ordered his servant to carry their luggage aboard the boat. As husband and wife were about to board together, Liu Hong opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin: her face was as bright as the full moon, her eyes like autumn waters, her lips cherry-red, and her waist slender as a willow branch—indeed possessing beauty enough to make fish sink and wild geese fall from the sky, a countenance so dazzling it could shame the moon and blush flowers. Instantly consumed by wolfish intent, he conspired with Li Biao, steering the boat to an uninhabited stretch of water. When midnight struck, they first killed the servant, then beat Guangrui to death, dumping both bodies into the river. Seeing her husband slain, the young lady prepared to throw herself into the water as well. But Liu Hong grabbed her tightly, saying, “If you yield to me, all will be forgiven! If not, I’ll cut you down right here!” With no other choice, the lady reluctantly agreed, submitting to Liu Hong for the time being. The villain then rowed the boat to the southern shore, handing it over to Li Biao to manage, while he himself donned Guangrui’s attire and official credentials, taking the lady with him to assume his post in Jiangzhou.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the body of the murdered servant drifted downstream with the current, but Guangrui’s corpse sank to the bottom and remained motionless. A sea demon patrolling near the mouth of the Hong River happened to notice it and immediately reported to the Dragon King’s palace. At that very moment, the Dragon King was presiding over court when the demon reported: “Today, near the mouth of the Hong River, someone unknown has beaten to death a scholar and left his body at the bottom of the water.” The Dragon King ordered the body to be brought forth and examined closely. Upon inspection, he declared, “This man is none other than my savior! How could he have been murdered? As the saying goes, one repays kindness with kindness. Today, I must save his life to repay the favor he once showed me.” He immediately penned an official decree and dispatched the demon straight to the City God and Land Deity of Hongzhou, instructing them to retrieve the scholar’s soul and restore his life.\\n\\nThe City God and Land Deity summoned a little ghost to deliver Chen Guangrui’s soul to the demon, who carried it to the Crystal Palace and presented it to the Dragon King. The Dragon King asked, “Young scholar, what is your name and family name? Where are you from? Why did you come here, only to be murdered?” Guangrui bowed respectfully and replied, “I am Chen E, courtesy name Guangrui, from Hongnong County, Haizhou. I was fortunate enough to become the top scholar in the recent imperial examinations and appointed governor of Jiangzhou. On my way to take up my post with my wife, we boarded a boat by the riverbank, only to be betrayed by the villain Liu Hong, who coveted my wife and murdered me, casting my body into the water. Great King, please save me!” Hearing this, the Dragon King said, “So it is! Sir, the golden carp you released earlier was none other than myself. You saved my life, and now that you’re in trouble, how could I possibly refuse to help?” He then had Guangrui’s body placed aside, inserting a magical bead into his mouth to preserve it intact, so that one day it could regain its spirit and seek vengeance. He added, “For now, your true soul shall temporarily serve as a chief official in my underwater realm.” Guangrui bowed deeply in gratitude, and the Dragon King hosted a banquet in his honor, which need not be detailed further.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin loathed Liu the villain with every fiber of her being, wishing she could devour his flesh and flay his skin—but pregnant as she was, unsure whether the child was a boy or girl, she had no choice but to endure and comply for the time being. Before she knew it, they had arrived in Jiangzhou. Officials, clerks, and servants all came out to greet them. Local dignitaries arranged a grand banquet in the courthouse to celebrate. Liu Hong said, “My arrival here today is entirely due to your generous support.” The officials replied, “Your Excellency is highly talented and virtuous; naturally, you treat the people as your own children, keeping lawsuits simple and punishments light. We, your subordinates, are fortunate indeed—why be so modest?” After the banquet concluded, everyone dispersed.\\n\\nTime passed swiftly. One day, Liu Hong had urgent business far away, leaving the lady alone in the official residence, longing for her mother-in-law and husband. Sitting in the flower pavilion, she sighed deeply, suddenly feeling weary, with pain in her abdomen, and fainting to the ground. Unbeknownst to her, she gave birth to a son. Suddenly, a voice whispered in her ear: “Beloved daughter-in-law, heed my words carefully. I am the Star Lord of the South Pole, sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva’s command specifically to entrust this child to you. In the future, he will achieve great fame and distinction, far beyond the ordinary. When Liu the villain returns, he will surely harm this child, so you must protect him diligently. Your husband has already been rescued by the Dragon King; someday, husband and wife will reunite, mother and son will be reunited, and justice will finally be served. Remember my words well—wake up, wake up!” Having spoken these words, the voice vanished. The lady awoke, recalling every word clearly, clutching her child tightly, yet feeling utterly helpless. Suddenly, Liu Hong returned and, upon seeing the child, immediately tried to drown him. The lady quickly said, “It’s already late today; let’s wait until tomorrow to throw him into the river.” Fortunately, early the next morning, Liu Hong received urgent orders to leave on another distant errand. Secretly, the lady thought, “If we wait until the villain returns, this child’s life will be lost! Better to abandon him in the river now and let fate decide his destiny.”\\\"If Heaven takes pity on us and someone rescues this child, raising him as their own, perhaps we shall meet again someday.\\\" But fearing it might be difficult to recognize him later, she bit her finger until it bled, writing a blood letter detailing her parents' names, origins, and the full story of their plight. She then bit off the little toe from the child's left foot, using it as a distinctive mark. Taking a close-fitting undershirt, she wrapped the baby in it and, seizing an opportune moment, carried him out of the official residence. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, so the young lady hurried to the riverside and burst into tears. Just as she was about to abandon the child, she suddenly noticed a wooden plank drifting lazily along the riverbank. Bowing toward the heavens in prayer, she carefully placed the baby onto the plank, secured him with a strap, tied the blood letter to his chest, and gently pushed the makeshift raft into the river, letting fate guide its course. With tears streaming down her face, she returned to the residence without further ado.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the child floated downstream on the wooden plank, drifting steadily until he came to rest at the foot of Jinshan Temple. The abbot of Jinshan Temple was a venerable monk named Faming, who had attained profound enlightenment through spiritual cultivation and mastered the subtle secrets of immortality. While meditating in deep contemplation, he suddenly heard the cries of a baby. His heart stirred, and he hurried to the riverside, where he saw a tiny infant sleeping peacefully on a piece of driftwood. Hastily, he rescued the child and, upon examining the blood letter clutched in the baby's hand, learned of his origins. He gave the child a nickname, Jiangliu, entrusted him to others for care, and carefully preserved the blood letter as a precious keepsake. Time flew by like an arrow, days and months passing swiftly, and before anyone realized it, Jiangliu had grown into an eighteen-year-old youth. The abbot then called him forward, shaved his head, and ordained him as a monk, giving him the Dharma name Xuanzang. After receiving the precepts and having his head touched, Xuanzang resolved firmly to pursue the path of enlightenment.\\n\\nOne day, during the late spring season, everyone gathered beneath the shade of pine trees to listen to sutras, engage in meditation, and discuss profound teachings. At that very moment, a dissolute monk who indulged in meat and wine found himself utterly confounded by Xuanzang. Enraged, the monk lashed out, shouting, \\\"You wretched creature! You don't even know your own name or your parents—what right do you have to meddle here?\\\" Hearing such harsh words, Xuanzang knelt before his master in the temple, tears streaming down his face, and pleaded earnestly: \\\"All beings are born between heaven and earth, nourished by yin and yang and sustained by the five elements. It is only natural that one is born of a father and raised by a mother. How can there be a person in this world without parents?\\\" He continued to implore his master repeatedly, begging to learn the names of his parents. The abbot finally said, \\\"If you truly wish to find your parents, come with me to my quarters.\\\" Xuanzang followed him to the abbot's chamber, where the elder climbed up to the rafters, retrieved a small box, and opened it to reveal the blood letter and the undershirt, handing them over to Xuanzang. As Xuanzang unfolded the blood letter and read it carefully, he finally learned the full details of his parents' names and the tragic circumstances surrounding their wrongful deaths. Upon finishing the reading, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly: \\\"How can I call myself human if I cannot avenge my parents' wrongs? For eighteen years, I've lived without knowing my birth parents, and only today do I discover that I have a mother. Had it not been for my master rescuing and nurturing me, how could I stand here today? Please allow me to go seek out my mother, and afterward, I will carry incense bowls on my head, rebuild the temple, and repay my master's immense kindness!\\\"\\n\\nThe master replied, \\\"If you wish to find your mother, take this blood letter and undershirt with you. Simply beg alms as you travel directly to the private residence in Jiangzhou, and there you shall surely meet your mother.\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang accepted his master's instructions, disguised himself as a mendicant monk, and set off straight for Jiangzhou. Coincidentally, Liu Hong happened to be away on business, and fate seemed to bring mother and son together. Xuanzang arrived at the gate of the private residence, chanting sutras and calling out, \\\"Alms, please!\\\" Lady Yin, meanwhile, had dreamt the previous night of a waning moon that had fully regained its roundness. She mused to herself, \\\"My mother-in-law remains missing, my husband was murdered by bandits, and my son was cast into the river. If someone has adopted him, he must now be eighteen years old. Perhaps today, heaven has arranged for us to meet again—it cannot be mere coincidence.\\\" As she pondered these thoughts, she suddenly heard someone chanting sutras outside the residence, calling out, \\\"Alms, please!\\\" Seizing the opportunity, she stepped out and asked, \\\"From where do you come?\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang replied, \\\"I am a humble monk, a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple.\\\"\\n\\nLady Yin exclaimed, \\\"So you are indeed a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple—\\\" and invited him inside, offering him a meal. As she observed his demeanor and speech closely, she noticed a striking resemblance to her late husband. She dismissed her maidservants and asked, \\\"Young master, did you become a monk from childhood, or did you enter the monastic life later in life? What is your full name, and do you still have living parents?\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang answered, \\\"I did not become a monk in childhood, nor did I enter the priesthood in middle age. To tell you the truth, my grievances are as vast as the sky, and my hatred runs as deep as the sea! My father was treacherously murdered, and my mother was taken by bandits. My master, Abbot Faming, instructed me to come to the Jiangzhou residence and search for my mother.\\\"\\n\\nLady Yin asked, \\\"What is your mother's surname?\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang replied, \\\"My mother's surname is Yin, her given name is Wenjiao; my father's surname is Chen, his given name is Guangrui; my childhood nickname was Jiangliu, and my Dharma name is Xuanzang.\\\"\\n\\nLady Yin declared, \\\"Wenjiao—that is me! But what proof do you have to support your claim?\\\"Upon hearing that it was his mother, Xuanzang dropped to his knees and burst into tears: “If my mother doesn’t believe me, here’s proof—a blood-written undershirt!” Wenjiao took the undershirt and examined it carefully; sure enough, it was genuine. Mother and son embraced each other, weeping bitterly, and she urged him, “My son, hurry and leave at once!” Xuanzang replied, “For eighteen years I’ve never known my birth parents, and only today have I finally met my mother—how can I bear to part from her?” The young lady said, “My son, you must quickly make your escape! If Liu the bandit returns, he’ll surely take your life! Tomorrow I’ll pretend to fall ill, claiming that years ago I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk’s shoes, and I’ll come to your temple to fulfill that vow. At that time, I’ll have something important to tell you.” Xuanzang, following her advice, bowed farewell.\\n\\nNow, ever since seeing her son, the young lady had been filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry. One day, she suddenly feigned illness, refusing food and drink, and lay down in bed. When Liu Hong returned to the office and asked about the reason, she said, “When I was young, I made a vow to donate one hundred pairs of monk’s shoes. Five days ago, I dreamt of a monk holding a sharp blade, demanding those shoes, and ever since then I’ve felt unwell.” Liu Hong exclaimed, “Why didn’t you mention such a trivial matter earlier?” He immediately ordered Wang Zuo Ya and Li You Ya to convene in court: all households in Jiangzhou city were instructed to prepare one pair of monk’s shoes each, with a deadline of five days for completion. The people dutifully fulfilled the order. Then the young lady turned to Liu Hong and asked, “Now that the monk’s shoes are ready, which temple would be suitable for me to go and fulfill my vow?” Liu Hong replied, “In Jiangzhou there’s Jinshan Temple and Jiaoshan Temple—whichever temple you prefer, you may choose.” The young lady said, “I’ve long heard that Jinshan Temple is an excellent monastery, so I shall go there.” Liu Hong immediately summoned Wang and Li, ordering them to prepare a boat.\\n\\nThe young lady brought along her trusted attendants, boarded the boat, and as soon as the oars pushed off, they headed straight for Jinshan Temple.\\n\\nMeanwhile, back at the temple, Xuanzang reported everything to Elder Faming, who was overjoyed upon hearing the tale.\\n\\nThe next day, a maid arrived first, announcing that the lady had come to the temple to fulfill her vow. All the monks came out to greet her.\\n\\nThe young lady walked directly through the temple gates, paid homage to the Bodhisattva, and arranged a grand vegetarian feast. She then instructed her maids to place the monk’s shoes and socks on a tray. When she reached the main hall, she again lit incense and offered prayers, after which she asked Elder Faming to distribute the offerings among the monks. Once the monks had dispersed and the hall was empty, Xuanzang knelt forward. The young lady asked him to remove his shoes and socks, and indeed, a small toe was missing from his left foot. At that moment, the two embraced once more, weeping uncontrollably, and expressed their gratitude to the elder for raising him. Faming said, “Now that mother and son have reunited, there’s a risk that the villain might find out. You must quickly withdraw before disaster strikes.” The young lady added, “My son, I’m giving you this ring as a token. Head northwest toward Hongzhou, a journey of roughly fifteen hundred li. There, in Wanhuadian, you’ll find Granny Zhang, your father’s own mother. I’ve also written you a letter to deliver to the imperial palace in Tang’s capital, to the home of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, on the left side of the Golden Hall—those are your maternal grandparents. Hand my letter to your grandfather, and ask him to petition the Tang emperor, gather troops, capture this villain, avenge your father, and only then will your mother’s life be saved. I dare not linger here any longer, for fear that the villain might suspect me if I return late.” With that, she left the temple, boarded the boat, and departed.\\n\\nXuanzang returned to the temple, weeping, and informed his master before bidding farewell immediately, heading straight for Hongzhou. Upon arriving at Wanhuadian, he asked the shopkeeper, Liu Xia’er, “Years ago, a guest named Chen from Jiangzhou stayed at your inn with his mother. How is she doing now?” Liu Xia’er replied, “She did stay at my inn, but later her eyesight failed, and for three or four years she didn’t pay me rent. Now she lives in a dilapidated kiln near the South Gate, begging daily on the streets to survive. That guest left long ago, and since then we’ve had no news of him whatsoever—no one knows why.” Upon hearing this, Xuanzang immediately went to the South Gate and found the old woman living in the broken kiln. The old woman exclaimed, “Your voice sounds just like my son, Chen Guangrui!” Xuanzang replied, “I’m not Chen Guangrui—I’m his son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother.” The old woman asked, “Why haven’t your parents come?” Xuanzang answered, “My father was beaten to death by bandits, and my mother was taken by force as their wife.” The old woman continued, “How did you know to come looking for me?” Xuanzang explained, “My mother sent me to find you. She gave me a letter and a ring.” The old woman took the letter and the ring, bursting into tears as she cried out, “My son came all this way for fame and success—I thought he’d betrayed us and forgotten his kindness, never imagining he’d been murdered!”And I am glad that the emperor has pity on me. After my son, today there are grandchildren looking for me.\\\" Xuanzang asked, \\\"Why are your mother-in-law's eyes faint?\\\" The mother-in-law said, \\\"I cried so hard that my eyes fainted because I thought about your father all day long and I didn't see him coming.\\\" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the Sky: \\\"Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and his parents' hatred cannot be avenged. Today, I took my mother's order to find my mother-in-law. If the sky shows my disciple's sincerity, I will keep my mother-in-law's eyes clear!\\\" After wishing, he licked the tip of his tongue and his mother-in-law's eyes. In a moment, my eyes lick open and still return to the same place. The mother-in-law looked at the young monk and said, \\\\n \\\"You are my grandson! It's just like my son Guang Rui!\\\" The mother-in-law was happy and sad. Xuanzang took her mother-in-law out of the kiln door, went to Liu Xiaoer's shop, and put some money in a house to live with her mother-in-law. Then she entangled herself with her mother-in-law and said, \\\"I'll be back in less than a month.\\\" \\\\n Then he quit his mother-in-law and headed for the capital. He found Prime Minister Yin's Mansion on Huangcheng East Street and said to the door, \\\"The little monk is a relative. Come to visit Xianggong.\\\" The door was informed of the prime minister, who said, \\\"I have no relatives with the monk.\\\" The wife said, \\\"I dreamed last night that my daughter came home full of charming, unless my son-in-law came back with letters.\\\" The Prime Minister then taught the young monk to come to the hall. When the young monk saw the Prime Minister and his wife, he cried and bowed to the ground. He took out a book from his arms and handed it to the prime minister. The Prime Minister opened it, read it from the beginning, and cried bitterly. The lady asked, \\\"What was the accident?\\\" The Prime Minister said, \\\"This Monk is my nephew and yours. Son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by thieves, and Mantang Jiao was forcibly taken as his wife by thieves.\\\" Madame listened and cried bitterly. The Prime Minister said: \\\"Madam is worried. Come to the court to tell the Lord and personally command the troops. You must avenge your son-in-law.\\\" \\\\n The next day, the prime minister entered the dynasty and inspired the Tang King to say: \\\"Today, Chen Guangrui, the top scholar of his son-in-law, led his family Xiaojiang to take office. He was killed by Liu Hong, a little water, and took his daughter as his wife. He pretended to be a son-in-law and became an official for many years. This is a change. His Majesty beggars immediately sent troops to eliminate thieves.\\\" When the King of the Tang Dynasty saw that he was furious, he sent 60,000 Imperial troops to the Prime Minister Yin to supervise the soldiers. The Prime Minister led the decree out of the court, that is, he ordered soldiers to the teaching ground and headed for Jiangzhou. Xiao Xing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, but he did not realize he had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's soldiers and horses all went down to camp on the north bank. Starry night ordered the gold medal to be called to Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state sentenced two people. The Prime Minister told him that he knew about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before the sky was clear, Liu Hong's Yamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the Golden Drums were ringing, and the soldiers killed into the private office. Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured early. The Prime Minister handed down a military order to tie Liu Hong and his men to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city. \\\\n The Prime Minister went straight into the main hall of the government office and sat down. Please ask the young lady to come out and meet. If the young lady wants to stay and go out, she will hang herself if she is ashamed of her father. Hearing this, Xuanzang hurriedly rescued his mother, knelt down on his knees and said to his mother, \\\"Son and grandfather, unify the troops here and avenge your father. Today, the thief has been captured. Why did my mother want to die? If the mother dies, how can the child survive?\\\" The Prime Minister also went to the government to persuade him. The young lady said, \\\"I heard that the woman died from one thing. Tongfu has been killed by thieves, how can he be ashamed of being a thief? Because of the posthumous body, had to endure shame to steal life. Today, Xing'er has grown up and seen his old father take revenge for his daughter. What will he see! Only death can repay her husband's ear!\\\" \\\\n The Prime Minister said: \\\"This is not my son's change of course with ups and downs. It is all because of a last resort. Why should I be ashamed!\\\" Father and son hugged and cried, and Xuanzang also mourned. The Prime Minister wiped away his tears and said, \\\"You two should stop worrying. I have captured the enemy thief now, and I will send it off.\\\" That is, I got up and went to the Dharma Field. It happened that Jiangzhou Tongzhi also sent sentinels to take the water thief Li Biao.The prime minister was overjoyed and immediately ordered the soldiers to bring Liu Hong and Li Biao forward. Each was flogged severely with one hundred strokes, after which they confessed under duress, admitting their conspiracy years ago to murder Chen Guangrui. First, Li Biao was nailed onto a wooden donkey, dragged to the marketplace, and executed by being sliced into a thousand pieces, his head then displayed publicly as a warning. Next, Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang ferry crossing, the very spot where he had killed Chen Guangrui years ago. The prime minister, accompanied by the young lady and Xuanzang, personally went to the riverside, offering prayers toward the heavens. They then cruelly gouged out Liu Hong's heart and liver, using them as offerings for Guangrui, and burned a memorial text as part of the ritual.\\n\\nThe three stood by the river weeping bitterly, an act that soon alarmed the underwater realm. A sea patrol Yaksha quickly presented the memorial text to the Dragon King. After reading it, the Dragon King dispatched General Bie Wu to summon Guangrui. \\\"Sir,\\\" said the Dragon King, \\\"congratulations! Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all at the riverside paying tribute to you. I shall now restore your soul. Moreover, I offer you one如意珠, two walking beads, ten lengths of fine silk, and a beaded jade belt. Today, you shall finally reunite with your wife, child, and mother.\\\" Guangrui bowed repeatedly in gratitude. The Dragon King then instructed the Yaksha to carry Guangrui's body out of the river mouth and restore his soul. The Yaksha accepted the order and departed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin had finished mourning her husband and was about to throw herself into the water to end her life, but Xuanzang desperately grabbed hold of her, preventing her from doing so. In the midst of this chaos, suddenly a corpse floated up on the water's surface, drifting close to the riverbank. Miss Yin hurried forward to examine it and recognized her husband's body, bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone gathered around to watch, and they saw Guangrui slowly stretching his fists and legs, his body gradually coming back to life. Suddenly, he sat up, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Guangrui opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin, his father-in-law Prime Minister Yin, and the little monk all weeping beside him. Guangrui asked, \\\"Why are you all here?\\\" Miss Yin replied, \\\"Because you were murdered by bandits, and later I gave birth to our son. Fortunately, he was raised by the abbot of Jinshan Temple and eventually found me. I sent him to seek out your father, who learned of your fate and petitioned the court. He led troops here, captured the bandits, and just now, they took your heart and liver as offerings to you. I never imagined you would come back to life!\\\" Guangrui explained, \\\"It's all because years ago, when we were at the Wanhuadeng shop, I bought and released that golden carp. Little did I know that carp was actually the Dragon King of these waters. When the villain pushed me into the river, it was thanks to him that I survived. Now he has restored my soul and bestowed upon me these treasures. And I never expected you to give birth to our son, nor that my father-in-law would avenge me. Truly, after enduring so much hardship, sweet happiness has finally arrived—a joy beyond measure!\\\"\\n\\nUpon hearing the news, all the officials came to congratulate them. The prime minister ordered a banquet to be prepared, thanking his subordinates before the army began its return journey. Arriving at Wanhuadeng, the prime minister ordered the troops to set up camp. Guangrui, accompanied by Xuanzang, went to Liu's shop to find his mother-in-law. That night, she had a dream: a withered tree blossomed, and magpies chirped incessantly behind her house. She thought, \\\"Could it be my grandson returning?\\\" Before she could finish her thoughts, Guangrui and his son appeared at the door. The little monk pointed and said, \\\"Isn't that my grandmother?\\\" Upon seeing his aged mother, Guangrui immediately knelt down and prostrated himself. Mother and son embraced, weeping bitterly, and recounted everything that had happened. After settling the bill at the inn, they set off for the capital. Upon entering the prime minister's residence, Guangrui, Miss Yin, his mother, and Xuanzang all met the lady of the house. Overjoyed, she ordered her servants to prepare a grand feast in celebration.\\n\\nThe prime minister declared, \\\"Let us call today's banquet the Reunion Feast.\\\" It truly was a joyful family gathering.\\n\\nThe next morning, Emperor Tang ascended the throne, and Prime Minister Yin stepped forward to report in detail all that had transpired, recommending Guangrui for high office. The emperor approved the recommendation and immediately appointed Chen E as a scholar, entrusting him with state affairs. Xuanzang resolved to devote himself to Zen meditation and was sent to practice at Hongfu Temple. Later, Miss Yin calmly took her own life, and Xuanzang returned to Jinshan Temple to express gratitude to Abbot Faming. As for what happened afterward, we shall leave that for the next installment.\\n\\nTable of Contents, Chapter Nine: Yuan Shoucheng's Brilliant Calculation, Free from Selfish Intentions; the Old Dragon King's Foolish Scheme Violates Heavenly Law\\n\\nPoem:\\n\\nA great city in the capital, truly worth beholding,\\nEight rivers flow around the four mountains.\\nHow many emperors rose from this place;\\nSince ancient times, the world speaks of Chang'an.\\n\\nThis chapter specifically describes the great city of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, the site where emperors of successive dynasties established their capitals. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, the land has been adorned with colorful flowers, and eight rivers flow around the city. Thirty-six flower-lined alleys and seventy-two music pavilions stand proudly.According to the map of Hua and Yi, the world’s foremost region truly is a land of extraordinary beauty. Now, Emperor Taizong Wen of the Tang Dynasty has ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Longji Zhenguan. It has already been thirteen years since his coronation, and the current year is Ji Si. Not to mention the heroic figures who stand before him, safeguarding the realm and stabilizing the country, nor those outstanding talents who fought bravely to expand its borders.\\n\\nNow, let us speak of two virtuous men living by the Jing River outside Chang’an city: one is a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other a woodcutter named Li Ding. Both are scholars who failed the imperial examinations but are literate mountain folk. One day, after selling their firewood in Chang’an and trading the carp from their baskets, they entered an inn together, enjoyed themselves until half-drunk, each carrying a bottle, and slowly strolled back along the banks of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:\\n\\n“Brother Li, I think those who strive for fame end up sacrificing their bodies for it; those who chase profit lose themselves in pursuit of gain; those who accept titles sleep with tigers by their side; and those who bask in favor carry snakes up their sleeves. When you come down to it, we’re better off enjoying our serene waters and verdant mountains, living freely and carefree, content with simplicity, letting fate guide us.”\\n\\nLi Ding replied, “Brother Zhang, you make a valid point. But your beautiful waters aren’t as good as my lush mountains.”\\n\\nZhang Shao retorted, “Your lush mountains aren’t as fine as my beautiful waters.”\\n\\nTo prove his point, he quoted a poem titled “Die Lian Hua”:\\n\\n“On misty waters stretching ten thousand li, a tiny boat drifts alone, quietly moored beneath a lone awning, the voice of Xi Shi lingers round about. Free from worldly cares, cleansed of greed and fame, I leisurely pluck reeds and smartweeds by the willow-lined shore. A few sand terns delight my eyes, in willow groves and reed bays, my wife and children laugh with joy. After a peaceful sleep, the winds and waves seem playful—no honor, no disgrace, no worries at all.”\\n\\nLi Ding countered, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Die Lian Hua’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“In a stretch of cloud-covered woods, pines bloom profusely; silently I listen to the warbling birds, their tongues as skillful as flutes. The red fades, the green grows rich—the spring is warm, yet summer swiftly arrives. Then autumn comes easily, changing everything; golden flowers bloom, perfect for admiring. And soon winter arrives sharp as a finger snap, yet I roam free through all four seasons, unbothered by anyone.”\\n\\nThe fisherman said, “Your lush mountains can’t compare to my beautiful waters. Let me share a ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to illustrate how much better off we are:\\n\\n“In the fairyland of clouds and water, life is complete; a boat with oars laid across is my home. Fresh scales I slice, green turtles I cook; purple crabs steamed, red shrimp boiled. Green bamboo shoots, water plantain sprouts—water caltrops and lotus roots are even more delightful. Tender lotus roots, aged lotus seeds, tender celery leaves—water chestnuts, water bamboo, and bird’s-eye flowers.”\\n\\nThe woodcutter replied, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to show how much better we have it:\\n\\n“Towering peaks reach toward the horizon, a thatched hut is my home. Cured chicken, goose, crab, and turtle—wild boar, roe deer, hare, and deer surpass fish and shrimp. Chinese toon leaves, yellow catalpa buds—bamboo shoots and mountain tea are even more splendid. Purple plums, red peaches, ripe apricots and plums, sweet pears, sour jujubes, osmanthus blossoms.”\\n\\nThe fisherman insisted, “Your lush mountains really can’t compete with my beautiful waters. Here’s another ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“A little boat drifts wherever it may, amid countless layers of misty waves, fearless and free. Casting hooks and nets, I catch fresh fish, not greasy or oily, yet delicious beyond compare; old wife and young child gather round for reunion. With plenty of fish, I head to Chang’an market, trade for fine wine, and drink myself into a stupor. My raincoat serves as blanket on the autumn river, snoring peacefully, without a care, unattached to worldly honors or riches.”\\n\\nThe woodcutter retorted, “Brother Zhang, your beautiful waters still can’t match the joy of my mountain life. Here’s a ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“A few thatched huts built beneath the hills, pines, bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids—how lovely they are! Through forests and over ridges, I search for dry firewood, no one scolds me, I sell as I please, more or less depending on the world. With the money earned, I buy wine and drink at will, savoring freedom in earthenware bowls and porcelain cups. Drunken and drowsy, I lie beneath the pines, unburdened, unconcerned, indifferent to rise or fall in this mortal world.”\\n\\nThe fisherman concluded, “Brother Li, your mountain life can’t match the joy of my riverside business. Here’s a ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“The red smartweed blooms profusely under moonlight, yellow reeds sway wildly in the breeze. The azure sky stretches far, the Chu River flows empty and clear, stirring the reflections of stars in the pond. Big fish swim in schools into the net, small mandarin fish cluster around the hook. Once caught, they taste especially rich when cooked—laughing and joking, I roam the rivers and lakes.”\\n\\nThe woodcutter responded, “Brother Zhang, your riverside life still can’t match the joy of my mountain business. Here’s another ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“Withered leaves and dead vines fill the paths, broken branches and old bamboo cover the hills. Wild vines and dried kudzu twine wildly, I gather them, tie them up, and carry them off. Worm-eaten hollow elm and willow, wind-broken pine and nanmu trees—\\nI collect them, pile them up for winter’s cold, and trade them for wine and money.”The fisherman said, \\\"Though your mountain may be comparable, it still can't match the serene elegance of my waters. Here's a poem to prove it: As the tide ebbs, a lone boat drifts away; at night's deep hour, the oarsman's song fades off. Under the crescent moon, my raincoat brings such quiet charm—wakeful gulls startled, yet unable to rise; colorful clouds part in the sky. Lying idly on the reed isle, with nothing to do, I linger until the sun climbs three poles high. Following my heart's desire, I arrange my days as I please; while courtiers shiver waiting for the watchman's call, how could they compare to my carefree spirit?\\\" The woodcutter replied, \\\"Your waters' tranquil grace cannot rival the deeper serenity of my green mountains, and here's another poem to attest: On autumn paths, I stride forth with axe in hand; in evening coolness, I return bearing my load. Wildflowers tucked into my hair bring even greater wonder—parting clouds, I find my way; waiting for the moon, I knock at the gate. My young son and mountain wife greet me with joyful smiles; on a bed of grass and wooden pillow, I stretch and rest. Steaming pears and cooking millet, I quickly prepare; new brew matures in jars—truly, this deepens my tranquil heart!\\\" The fisherman continued, \\\"These are merely our trades, our means of sustenance. You lack the joys I find in leisure time, as this poem shows: Leisurely watching white cranes fly across the sky, I moor my boat by the stream and close the green door. Leaning against the cabin, I teach my child to twist fishing lines, and after rowing, spread the nets out with my wife. With calm resolve, I truly sense the waves have stilled; at ease, I naturally feel the breeze grow mild. A green raincoat and bamboo hat I wear at will—far better than donning purple robes in court.\\\" The woodcutter responded, \\\"Yet your leisure time still doesn't match mine, as this poem also proves: Leisurely watching wispy clouds drift by, I sit alone in my thatched hut, closing the bamboo door. Without tasks, I instruct my child to read from scrolls; sometimes, I gather friends to play chess. When joy comes, I lean on my staff and sing along fragrant paths; when inspiration strikes, I carry my zither up to verdant heights. Straw sandals, hemp ropes, coarse cloth for bedding—such contentment far surpasses fine silken robes.\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\"Li Ding, we truly can enjoy light verses together without needing drums or golden goblets. Let's exchange a few lines each, and see how well we fishermen and woodcutters converse.\\\" Li Ding replied, \\\"Brother Zhang speaks most wisely; please begin with a verse.\\\" \\\"My boat rests in emerald waters amid misty ripples, my home lies deep in mountains and wild fields. I especially love spring floods over stream bridges, and most cherish morning mists among rocky peaks. Fresh carp from Longmen often graced my pot, dry firewood charred under daily flames. Fishing nets provide various ways to support old age, carrying poles sustain me till the end. In my small boat, I lie back watching geese take flight, along grassy paths slanting, listening to cranes cry out. In the marketplace of words, I hold no stake; in seas of right and wrong, my trace grows faint. By the stream, cloths hang drying like brocade, on stones I sharpen axes sharp as blades. Under autumn moons, I often fish alone; in spring mountains, no one meets me in solitude. When fish abound, I trade them for wine to share with my wife; leftover firewood sells to buy more liquor for my children. Singing and sipping freely, I let loose and roam; long songs and sighs, I yield to winds that toss and turn. Calling brothers and shipmates, I invite fellow travelers; friends and companions gather with rustic folk. Drinking games and fist-clenching contests pass cups repeatedly; card games and wordplay fill the hours with laughter. Cooking shrimp and crabs brings daily delight, stir-frying duck and braising chicken makes every day rich. My simple wife brews tea with playful ease, my mountain wife cooks meals with calm assurance. At dawn, I raise my staff to stir gentle waves, at sunrise, I carry firewood over rushing streams. After rain, I don my raincoat to catch live carp; in wind, I wield my axe to fell dead pines. Hiding from the world, I feign foolishness and dullness, concealing my name and living mute and deaf.\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\"Brother Li, I took the liberty of starting first; now it's your turn—please begin a couplet, and I shall follow.\\\" \\\"A madman of mountains and wilds, pretending madness in wind and moonlight, an old man lingering proudly in rivers and lakes. Free time belongs to those who live carefree lives, free from gossip, rejoicing in peace. On moonlit nights, I sleep soundly in a thatched hut; in dusk, a light bamboo cloak shields my body. Lost in joy, I make friends with pine and plum, gladly pledge with gulls and egrets. No schemes for fame and fortune occupy my mind; no sounds of strife reach my ears. A sip of fragrant homemade wine at any hour, three meals of wild vegetable soup each day. Two bundles of firewood sustain my life, a fishing rod provides my livelihood. I casually call my child to sharpen steel axes, quietly summon my simple lad to mend old cloths. In spring, I love watching willows turn green, when seasons blend, I delight in reeds and rushes. In summer, I escape the heat by tending new bamboo shoots, in June, I cool off picking tender water caltrops. When frost descends, chickens grow plump and ready for slaughter, on Double Ninth Festival, crabs thrive and are cooked just in time. In winter, I still sleep late as the sun rises, through the Nine Cold Days, I stay warm without steaming. Through all eight seasons, I let my nature run free in the mountains; in four seasons, I indulge my heart by the lake. Gathering firewood brings the joy of immortals, fishing bears no mark of worldly ties. Outside my door, wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues; before my boat, green waters ripple smoothly. Content in my humble state, I need not speak of high office; my settled nature surpasses even a city ten miles wide.\\\"“Ten miles of city walls, high defenses and strict orders; three high officials, their status renowned, listening to imperial edicts. To enjoy mountains and waters is truly rare—how grateful we are to Heaven, Earth, and the gods!” As they exchanged verses and linked their poetic lines, they reached the point where their paths diverged and bowed farewell to each other. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, take care on your journey! Be cautious when climbing the mountain, watch out for tigers. If any danger should arise, tomorrow’s street might see one less old friend!” Upon hearing this, Li Ding flew into a rage: “You lazy scoundrel! True friends share life and death together—how dare you curse me like that? If I meet with harm from a tiger, you’ll surely face the waves and be swept away by the river!” Zhang Shao replied, “I swear I’ll never be tossed about by rivers again.” Li Ding retorted, “Heaven holds unpredictable storms, and fate brings temporary fortune or misfortune. How can you guarantee you’ll remain unscathed?” Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, though you speak thus, you haven’t grasped the truth; my business, at least, offers some certainty—I’m certain I won’t encounter such trouble.” Li Ding asked, “Your livelihood on the water is extremely dangerous and perilous, shrouded in mystery and obscurity—what certainty can there be?” Zhang Shao replied, “You simply don’t understand. In Chang’an city, on West Gate Street, there’s a fortune-teller who sells divination. Every day I bring him a golden carp, and he secretly passes me a lesson, guiding me by direction, always hitting the mark. Today I went to buy another reading, and he instructed me to cast my net east of Jinghe Bay’s bend and set my line along the western bank—surely I’ll return with a boatload of fish and shrimp. Tomorrow I’ll come into the city, sell my catch, buy wine, and meet up with you again.” With these words, the two parted ways.\\n\\nAs they spoke, someone was lurking in the grass. It turned out that a night demon patrolling the waters of the Jing River had overheard the talk about hitting the mark every time. He quickly rushed back to the Crystal Palace and urgently reported to the Dragon King:\\n\\n“Trouble! Trouble!” The Dragon King asked, “What kind of trouble?” The night demon replied, “While patrolling the riverbank, I heard two fishermen chatting. As they parted, their words were quite alarming. One fisherman said there’s a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an city who makes the most accurate predictions. Every day he gives him a carp, and the fortune-teller secretly teaches him how to hit the mark every single time. If his predictions prove true, won’t he end up wiping out all the aquatic creatures? How then can our underwater palace maintain its splendor, and how can we continue leaping through waves and assisting Your Majesty’s power?” The Dragon King was furious and immediately drew his sword, ready to march on Chang’an and destroy this fortune-teller. But just then, dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp ministers and crab officials, shad generals, mandarin fish lieutenants, and carp prime ministers stepped forward and jointly petitioned:\\n\\n“Your Majesty, please calm down. As the saying goes, words heard casually should not be taken at face value. If Your Majesty goes now, clouds will surely gather, rain will surely fall, and the people of Chang’an may be frightened, drawing blame from Heaven. Your Majesty’s presence is mysterious and unpredictable, capable of infinite transformations—but why not simply transform into a scholar and visit Chang’an yourself? If such a person exists, we can deal with him later; but if he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be unjust to harm others unnecessarily?” The Dragon King heeded their advice, laid down his sword, refrained from summoning clouds or rain, stepped ashore, and transformed himself into a scholar dressed in white, truly majestic and imposing, towering above the valleys and reaching toward the sky. His gait was dignified and proper, his conduct precise and upright. His speech followed Confucius and Mencius, his manners reflected the elegance of King Wen of Zhou. He wore a jade-colored robe and a leisurely headscarf with a single character embroidered on it. Setting off, he strode through the clouds and arrived directly on West Gate Street in Chang’an. There he saw a crowd gathered, bustling and noisy, filled with lively discussions: “Those born in the Year of the Dragon clash with those born in the Year of the Tiger. Though the combinations of Yin-Chen-Si-Hai are considered harmonious, what’s feared is the day clashing with the ruler of the year.” Hearing this, the Dragon King realized this must be the fortune-teller’s place. He stepped forward, pushed through the crowd, and peered inside. What he saw was a room adorned with pearls and jewels on all four walls, rich brocade and silk filling the hall.\\n\\nThe fragrance of precious incense never ceased, and the porcelain bottles held crystal-clear water. On either side hung paintings by Wang Wei, while above the seat hung an image of Guiguzi.\\n\\nA Duanxi inkstone, golden smoke ink, matched perfectly with a brush of frosty bristles; the Fire Pearl Forest and Guo Pu’s numerology stood beside the newly revised court texts. Six Lines mastered thoroughly, Eight Trigrams understood perfectly. Able to know heaven and earth, skilled at discerning spirits and gods. A compass arranged noon and midnight precisely, a belly full of stars clearly arrayed. Indeed, future events and past matters were as clear as moonlit mirrors; which families prospered and which declined, judged as clearly as divine insight. Foreseeing misfortune and determining good fortune, pronouncing death and proclaiming life. Speaking swiftly as wind and rain, writing so that ghosts and gods trembled. The sign read: “Divine Lessons, Master Yuan Shoucheng.” Who was this man? He turned out to be none other than Yuan Shoucheng, uncle of Yuan Tiangang, the current Imperial Astronomer and Chief of the Bureau of Astronomy.Indeed, the gentleman had an extraordinary appearance, graceful demeanor, and his fame spread throughout the land; his skills were unrivaled in Chang'an. The Dragon King entered and met with the gentleman. After exchanging formal greetings, he invited the Dragon to take a seat, and a young attendant presented tea. The gentleman then asked, \\\"What brings you here today?\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\"I've come to consult you about the weather forecast for tomorrow.\\\" The gentleman immediately drew a divination chart from his sleeve and declared, \\\"Clouds obscure the mountaintops, mist veils the treetops. If you're asking about rain, it will surely fall tomorrow.\\\" The Dragon King pressed further, \\\"At what exact time will it rain tomorrow? And how much rainfall can we expect?\\\" The gentleman answered, \\\"Tomorrow at Chen hour clouds will gather, at Si hour thunder will roll, at Wu hour rain will begin, and by Wei hour the rain will be sufficient, totaling three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points.\\\" The Dragon King laughed and said, \\\"This cannot be taken lightly! If it truly rains tomorrow according to your predicted timing and amount, I'll reward you with fifty taels of gold as a token of gratitude. But if it doesn't rain, or if the timing or amount is even slightly off, let me tell you plainly—I'll smash your facade, tear down your signboard, and drive you out of Chang'an immediately, never again allowed to deceive the people!\\\" The gentleman cheerfully responded, \\\"Very well, I accept your challenge. Please rest assured, the rain will certainly arrive tomorrow as predicted.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dragon King took his leave, departed Chang'an, and returned to the Water Palace. The lesser water deities greeted him and asked, \\\"How was your visit to that fortune-teller?\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\"Oh yes, indeed! What a smooth-talking fellow! I asked him when it would rain, and he confidently predicted tomorrow's rain. When I pressed him for specific times and amounts, he said clouds would form at Chen hour, thunder would strike at Si hour, rain would start at Wu hour, and by Wei hour the rainfall would reach three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points. So I made a wager with him: if his prediction comes true, I'll give him fifty taels of gold as a reward; but if there's even the slightest discrepancy, I'll destroy his facade, kick him out, and forbid him from ever deceiving people in Chang'an again!\\\" The aquatic creatures all laughed and said, \\\"Your Majesty is the Grand Master of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God in charge of rain—only you know whether it will rain or not. How dare he speak such nonsense? That fortune-teller is sure to lose! He's bound to lose!\\\"\\n\\nJust as the dragon princes, grandsons, and fish, carp, and crabs were still laughing and discussing this matter, they suddenly heard a voice echoing from mid-air: \\\"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial decree!\\\" Everyone looked up and saw a golden-clad warrior holding an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, heading straight toward the Water Palace. Startled, the Dragon King quickly straightened his robes, lit incense, and respectfully received the decree.\\n\\nAfter the golden-clad warrior returned to the heavens, the Dragon King expressed his gratitude, opened the sealed document, and read aloud: \\\"Imperial Edict to the General of the Eight Rivers, commanding thunder and lightning; tomorrow you shall bestow rain to benefit the city of Chang'an.\\\" The edict precisely matched the timing and rainfall amounts predicted by the gentleman, leaving the Dragon King utterly shaken and terrified. After regaining his composure, he addressed the aquatic beings: \\\"There truly are such spiritual individuals in this world! He truly possesses the ability to communicate with heaven and earth—there's no disputing it!\\\"\\n\\nThe strategist Shiji reported, \\\"Your Majesty, rest assured. What difficulty could there be in defeating him? I have a small plan that will silence that fellow once and for all.\\\" The Dragon King asked for details, and the strategist replied, \\\"If we alter the timing of the rain slightly and reduce the amount just a bit, his predictions will clearly be inaccurate. Won't that be enough to prove him wrong? Then we can tear down his signboard, chase him away, and there'll be no trouble at all!\\\" The Dragon King approved the strategy without hesitation.\\n\\nThe next day, he summoned Feng Bo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu, and ascended into the nine heavens above Chang'an. At the appointed time, clouds began to form at Si hour, thunder rumbled at Wu hour, rain fell at Wei hour, and finally ceased at Shen hour—but the total rainfall amounted to only three feet and forty points, one hour earlier than predicted and three inches and eight points less than promised. After issuing orders for his generals to withdraw, he transformed himself back into the guise of a refined scholar dressed in white and headed straight for Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling shop on West Gate Street. Without a word, he smashed the shop's signboard, brush, inkstone, and everything else. Meanwhile, the gentleman calmly sat in his chair, completely unfazed. The Dragon King then picked up a door panel and began striking and shouting, \\\"You deceitful charlatan who spreads false prophecies and misleads the masses! Your divinations are useless, your words absurd! Today's predicted timing and rainfall don't match reality, yet you still sit there boldly. Leave now, or I'll spare your life no longer!\\\" Yet Shoucheng remained utterly fearless, raising his head to the sky and coldly laughing, \\\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've committed no crime, but you, on the other hand, very much have! You may fool others, but you can't fool me. I know exactly who you are—you're not a scholar at all, but the Dragon King of the Jing River. You violated the Jade Emperor's decree by altering the timing and reducing the rainfall, thus breaking heavenly law!\\\"“You’re standing on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, where a fatal blow is inevitable—yet you still dare to scold me here?” Upon hearing this, the Dragon King was seized with fear, his hair standing on end. Hastily dropping the door panel, he straightened his clothes, bowed deeply, and knelt before the master, saying, “Please don’t take offense, Master. Those earlier words were merely spoken in jest; who could have foreseen that falsehood would become reality, and that I’d truly violated heavenly law? What can be done now? I beg you, Master, please save me!\\n\\n“Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t let you go.” Shoucheng replied, “I cannot save you myself, but I can point out a path for you to reincarnate.” The dragon said, “I humbly request your guidance.” The master continued, “Tomorrow at the third hour of noon, you are scheduled to appear before Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official, to be executed. If you truly wish to keep your life, you must quickly go and plead with Emperor Taizong of Tang, who reigns today. Wei Zheng is the chancellor under the Tang emperor; only by gaining his personal favor can you ensure safety.” Hearing this, the Dragon King bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, and departed.\\n\\nUnaware of how time had passed, the sun had already set in the west, and the moon rose high in the sky. One could see: mist condensed, mountains turned purple, crows weary as they returned home; travelers far from home sought refuge in inns. New geese perched on sandbanks by the ferry landing, and the Milky Way appeared. The watchman urged the passing of the night, while in the lonely village, lamplight flickered without flame. Smoke curled gently from hearths in quiet monasteries, and within butterfly dreams, people vanished from sight. The moon shifted, casting flower shadows onto the railing, stars twinkled wildly. The sound of dripping water marked the hours, and before one knew it, the deep night had already reached its midpoint.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King of the Jing River did not return to his underwater palace. Instead, he remained in mid-air, waiting until around midnight, when he gathered his clouds and dispersed his mists, heading straight for the entrance of the imperial palace. At that very moment, Emperor Taizong was dreaming he had stepped outside the palace gates, walking beneath the moonlit flowers. Suddenly, the Dragon King transformed into human form and knelt before him, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save me!”\\n\\nTaizong asked, “Who are you? How can I save you?” The Dragon King replied, “Your Majesty is a true dragon, while I am an ordinary dragon. Because I’ve broken heavenly law, I’m due to be executed by Your Majesty’s virtuous minister, Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. That’s why I’ve come to beg you—I implore Your Majesty to save me!”\\n\\nTaizong said, “If Wei Zheng is to carry out the execution, then I can indeed save you. Go with peace of mind.” Overjoyed, the Dragon King bowed deeply in gratitude and departed.\\n\\nNow, after waking from his dream, Emperor Taizong couldn’t stop thinking about it. By dawn, at the third watch, Taizong convened court, gathering officials from both civil and military ranks. There, one could see:\\n\\nSmoke veiled the Phoenix Pavilion, fragrant incense filled the Dragon Tower. Light shimmered on the vermilion throne, clouds brushed past the emerald canopy. Ruler and ministers harmonized as though they were Yao and Shun, ritual music and decorum approached the grandeur of Han and Zhou. Courtiers held lamps, palace maids fanned themselves, their reflections glowing brightly; peacock screens and Kylin halls sparkled everywhere. All cried out “Long live the Emperor!” and offered blessings for ten thousand years. Three silent whips cracked, and all bowed in ceremonial attire before the imperial crown. Palace flowers bloomed brilliantly, their heavenly fragrance filling the air; willows along the embankment swayed gently, accompanied by imperial music. Pearl curtains and jade drapes hung high, secured by golden hooks; dragon-and-phoenix fans and mountain-and-river banners adorned the royal carriage as it paused. Civil officials stood elegant and refined, military generals proud and alert. The imperial road distinguished high from low, and ranks lined up on the vermilion platform. Golden seals and purple ribbons honored three great elephants, symbolizing enduring prosperity for countless ages.\\n\\nOnce the officials had finished their greetings and dispersed into their respective groups, Emperor Taizong, with eyes like phoenixes and dragon pupils, carefully examined each one from head to toe. Among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui, and others; among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaogin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, Qin Shubao, and many more—all dignified and solemn, yet Wei Zheng, the chancellor, was conspicuously absent. Emperor Taizong summoned Xu Shiji to the throne and said, “Last night, I had a strange dream. I dreamed someone came forward to pay homage, claiming to be the Dragon King of the Jing River, who had broken heavenly law and was due to be executed by Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. He begged me to save him, and I promised to do so. Yet today, Wei Zheng is nowhere to be seen among the officials assembled. Why is that?”\\n\\nShiji replied, “This dream must be taken seriously. Wei Zheng will arrive shortly; Your Majesty must not let him leave the palace. Only by keeping him here for another day can we save the dragon from the dream.”\\n\\nDelighted, Emperor Taizong immediately issued an edict, ordering the imperial messenger to summon Wei Zheng to court.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Wei Zheng was at home, observing the celestial signs at night, burning precious incense, when suddenly he heard the cry of cranes echoing from the nine heavens. It was an envoy sent by Heaven, bearing a golden decree from the Jade Emperor, instructing him to execute the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream at the third hour of noon. Grateful for Heaven’s grace, Wei Zheng had already fasted and bathed, testing his wisdom sword and summoning his spiritual essence within his residence, which is why he hadn’t attended court. When the imperial messenger arrived with the decree, he was overcome with fear and anxiety, yet dared not disobey the emperor’s command. Thus, he hastily dressed and belted himself, taking the decree with him as he hurried to court, where he prostrated himself before the emperor and confessed his guilt.Emperor Tang issued an edict, saying, \\\"I hereby pardon you and declare you innocent.\\\" At that time, the ministers had not yet adjourned the court session. However, upon hearing these words, the emperor ordered the curtains to be drawn back and dismissed the assembly, leaving only Wei Zheng behind. He was summoned to the Golden Hall and then invited into the private audience chamber, where they first discussed strategies for ensuring peace within the realm and plans for stabilizing the country. As it neared the end of the fourth hour and the beginning of the fifth, the emperor instructed a palace attendant to bring out a large chessboard, saying, \\\"Let us play a game, my wise minister.\\\" The imperial consorts promptly brought forth the chessboard and set it up on the royal desk. Wei Zheng gratefully accepted the honor and immediately began playing chess with Emperor Tang.\\n\\nAs for the outcome of the game, we shall leave that for the next installment to reveal.\",\"usage\":{\"inputTokens\":1004,\"outputTokens\":1261,\"totalTokens\":2265}},\"httpStatusCode\":\"200\",\"message\":\"success\",\"requestId\":\"C2D45266-3135-1A06-AD7F-69E782ED596F\",\"success\":true},\"headers\":{\"access-control-allow-origin\":\"*\",\"date\":\"Fri, 12 Sep 2025 07:58:46 GMT\",\"vary\":\"Accept-Encoding\",\"x-acs-request-id\":\"C2D45266-3135-1A06-AD7F-69E782ED596F\",\"content-type\":\"application/json;charset=utf-8\",\"access-control-expose-headers\":\"*\",\"x-acs-trace-id\":\"20ab10e70295f6562ada5fe8d9f3eca7\"},\"statusCode\":200}\n\n{\"body\":{\"code\":\"success\",\"data\":{\"translation\":\"I ask: how many countless inquiries have we made at the Zen gate, only to find ourselves aged in vain at last? Grinding bricks into mirrors, piling up snow for sustenance—how many youthful years have we thus lost in delusion? Swallowing the vast ocean with a hair, fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed—why do we still wear golden crowns and forced smiles? When enlightenment dawns, we transcend the ten stages and three vehicles; yet if we linger, we remain trapped within the four realms of existence and six paths. Who has heard, beneath the shadowless tree before the cliff of utter emptiness, the cuckoo’s cry heralding spring’s dawn? The Caosi trail is perilous, and the clouds over Jiling run deep; here, old friends’ voices fade away. On cliffs of thousand-zhang ice, five-petaled lotuses bloom, and incense curls from the ancient temple’s hanging curtains. At that moment, when we discern the source and stream, we shall behold the Dragon King’s Three Treasures.\\n\\nThis poem is titled \\\"Su Wu Slow.\\\" It tells of our Buddha, Shakyamuni, bidding farewell to the Jade Emperor and returning to the sacred abode of Leiyin. There, he found three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great vajras, and countless bodhisattvas, each holding banners, canopies, wondrous treasures, and celestial flowers, arrayed in the spiritual realm of Spirit Mountain beneath the twin banyan trees to greet him. Ascending upon auspicious clouds, Shakyamuni addressed the assembly: \\\"With profound wisdom, I have manifested throughout the three realms. The fundamental nature is ultimately tranquil and extinguished, identical to the void, devoid of all things. To subdue the rebellious monkey was no easy task; few could comprehend it. Birth and death begin with names, and phenomena are as they appear.\\\" Having spoken, he emitted rays of sarira light, filling the sky with forty-two radiant white rainbows stretching north and south. Upon seeing this, the crowd prostrated themselves in reverence. Soon after, auspicious clouds gathered, forming a lotus throne of supreme quality, upon which he sat serenely. The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight vajras, and four bodhisattvas approached, palms joined in prayer, and asked: \\\"Who was it that stirred up chaos in Heaven and disturbed the peach banquet?\\\" Shakyamuni replied: \\\"That fellow is a demonic monkey born on Flower Fruit Mountain, whose crimes are immeasurable and beyond description. Even the heavenly generals could not subdue him, though Erlang captured him. Even Laozi's fiery refining could not harm him. When I arrived, he was amidst the thunder gods, flaunting his might and spirit. I stopped the fighting, questioned him about his origins. He claimed supernatural powers, the ability to transform, and to ride the somersault cloud, covering one hundred and eight thousand li in a single leap. We made a wager: if he couldn't escape my grasp, I would seize him and imprison him under Five Elements Mountain. The Five Emperors opened their golden palaces and jade chambers, inviting me to take the chief seat and holding a grand assembly to honor me, after which I departed.\\\"\\n\\nThe crowd rejoiced upon hearing this, praising him profusely. After expressing gratitude, they dispersed into their respective groups, each resuming their duties and enjoying pure bliss. Indeed:\\n\\nAuspicious mists fill the land of India, rainbow light surrounds the honored one. In the West, he is called first—the formless Dharma King! Often we see mystical monkeys offering fruit, deer carrying flowers; green phoenixes dance, colorful phoenixes sing; sacred turtles present longevity, cranes capture medicinal herbs. Enjoying the Pure Land of Jetavana, partaking in the dragon palace's realm of Dharma. Flowers bloom daily, fruits ripen at every hour, cultivating tranquility and returning to truth, practicing Zen with genuine results. Neither annihilation nor birth, neither increase nor decrease. Mist and rosy clouds drift freely back and forth, unaffected by cold or heat, time itself forgotten.\\n\\nAs the poem says:\\nFree to come and go, carefree and at ease, free from fear and sorrow. In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, all is open and clear; in the great thousandfold world, there is neither spring nor autumn.\\n\\nOne day, while residing between the sacred mountain of Leiyin and the moonlit Spirit Mountain, the Buddha summoned all the Buddhas, Arhats, protectors, bodhisattvas, vajras, monks, nuns, and others, saying: \\\"Since subduing the rebellious monkey and pacifying Heaven, I have remained unaware of the passage of time, yet I estimate half a millennium has passed in the mortal realm, and now it is the full-moon day of early autumn. I possess a precious basin filled with a hundred varieties of flowers and a thousand kinds of exotic fruits, among other treasures. How shall we celebrate this 'Ullambana Festival' together with the Dharma?\\\" Each member of the assembly joined their palms, bowed three times before the Buddha, and understood his intention. Then, Shakyamuni instructed Ananda to carry the basin of flowers and fruits, while Ksitigarbha scattered offerings, filling the crowd with gratitude. Everyone offered poems in thanks.\\n\\nThe poem of blessings says:\\nBlessings shine brightly before the revered one, blessings embrace the depths and extend far and wide. Boundless virtue endures as long as the earth, blessed connections link us to heaven. Fields of blessing expand yearly, the sea of fortune grows deeper with each passing year. Blessings fill the universe, abundant shade and endless growth, ever complete and boundless.\\n\\nThe poem of prosperity says:\\nProsperity weighs as heavily as mountains, the colorful phoenix sings its song. Prosperity brings timely good fortune, like the evening star shining brightly. Adding ten thousand measures of wealth ensures health and well-being, enjoying a thousand vessels of peace. Salaries rival heaven, eternally secure, names as vast as the sea, ever clearer. Thoughts of prosperity inspire admiration, titles of honor spread glory across myriad nations.\\\\The longevity poem says:\\\\The star of longevity presents colorful offerings to the Buddha. From here, the realm of longevity shines with splendor. Plates brimming with fruits of longevity emit auspicious radiance, and freshly picked flowers of longevity adorn the lotus pedestal. The poems of longevity are elegant and full of wonders, while the melodies of longevity harmonize beautifully with talented voices. Longevity extends as long as the sun and moon, and may it be as vast and serene as mountains and seas.\\\\After all the Bodhisattvas finished their offerings, they respectfully requested the Buddha to clearly explain the fundamental principles and trace the origins. The Buddha slightly opened his compassionate mouth, expounded the great Dharma, and proclaimed the true fruit, lecturing on the profound scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the perfection of the Five Skandhas. At that moment, heavenly dragons circled around, and flowers rained down in profusion. Indeed: \\\"The Zen mind brightly illuminates the moon over a thousand rivers, and true nature embraces the vastness of ten thousand miles of sky.\\\" After finishing his lecture, the Buddha addressed the assembly: \\\"In the four great continents I now manifest, sentient beings differ in goodness and evil from place to place. In the Eastern Continent of Jambudvipa, people revere heaven and earth, with clear minds and calm spirits. In the Northern Continent of Uttarakuru, though fond of their own kin, they merely struggle for survival, possessing simple natures and limited aspirations, rarely indulging in excess. In the Western Continent of Aparagodaniya, people neither covet nor kill, nurturing their qi and cultivating inner spirit; though lacking supreme truth, everyone enjoys a long life. But in the Southern Continent of Kalirupa, greed, lust, and delight in misfortune prevail, with much killing and strife—truly a battlefield of tongues and a sea of slander and evil. Now I have the Tripitaka scriptures, which can persuade people to do good.\\\"\\\\Upon hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas clasped their hands in reverence and approached the Buddha, asking: \\\"What are the three collections of the Tripitaka scriptures?\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\"I have one collection of Dharma, discussing heaven; one collection of Vinaya, speaking of earth; and one collection of Sutra, guiding ghosts. Together, these three collections comprise thirty-five volumes, totaling 15,144 scrolls, representing the path to cultivation and the gateway to righteousness. I intend to send them to the Eastern Land, but alas, the beings there are foolish, slandering the true words and failing to understand the essence of my teachings, neglecting the authentic Yoga tradition. How can we find someone powerful enough to journey to the Eastern Land, seek out a sincere believer, guide him through hardships across thousands of mountains and distant waters, bring him to me to obtain the true scriptures, and perpetually spread them in the Eastern Land? This would indeed be a blessing as vast as mountains and a fortune as deep as the sea. Who would be willing to undertake such a journey?\\\" At this point, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva stepped forward to the lotus pedestal, bowed three times before the Buddha, and said: \\\"Your disciple, though unworthy, is willing to go to the Eastern Land and find someone to retrieve the scriptures.\\\" All present looked up at the Bodhisattva:\\\\Perfect in virtue and wisdom, his golden body is filled with intelligence. Beaded garlands hang gracefully, fragrant rings gleam with precious light, dark clouds cleverly form coiled dragons, and embroidered ribbons gently flutter like colorful phoenix feathers. A jade clasp adorns his plain silk robe, surrounded by auspicious radiance; a brocade skirt and golden cords bring forth auspicious energy. His brows resemble crescent moons, his eyes like twin stars. Five faces naturally express joy, and his vermilion lips are touched with a hint of red. The vase of pure nectar overflows year after year, and the willow branch inserted askew remains ever green. He resolves eight difficulties and saves countless beings with great compassion; thus he dwells atop great mountains, resides in the South Sea, rescues those in suffering by responding to their cries, universally praised and answered, revered by thousands of saints and spirits. His heart delights in purple bamboo, and his nature cherishes fragrant vines. He is the compassionate lord of Mount Luojia, the living Avalokiteshvara in the Cave of Tidal Sounds.\\\\Seeing this, the Buddha was overjoyed and said: \\\"No one else can go; only the venerable Avalokiteshvara, with his vast supernatural powers, is capable of undertaking this mission.\\\" The Bodhisattva asked: \\\"If I go to the Eastern Land, do you have any instructions for me?\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\"On this journey, you must carefully examine the roads, not traveling through the heavens, but rather among clouds and mists. As you pass mountains and rivers, remember the distances and details of the route, and give careful guidance to the scripture seeker. Fearing that the sincere believer may find the journey difficult, I shall provide you with five treasures.\\\" Then he ordered Ananda and Kashyapa to bring forth a \\\"brocade kasaya robe\\\" and a \\\"nine-ringed staff,\\\" handing them to the Bodhisattva and saying: \\\"This robe and staff can be personally used by the scripture seeker. If he comes here with firm resolve, wearing my robe will prevent him from falling into reincarnation, and holding my staff will protect him from harm.\\\" \\\\The Bodhisattva received these items with reverence, and the Buddha then took three headbands and handed them to the Bodhisattva, saying: \\\"These treasures are called 'tightening bands.' Though there are three identical ones, each is used differently. I have three incantations of 'Golden Tightening Seal.' If on the road you encounter powerful demons, you must persuade them to reform and become disciples of the scripture seeker. If they refuse to obey, you may place this band on their head, and it will naturally take root in their flesh. By reciting the appropriate incantation, their eyes will swell, their head will ache, and their foreheads will split open, forcing them to enter my fold.\\\"Upon hearing these words, the Bodhisattva joyfully bowed and stepped back, immediately summoning Huai'an the Pilgrim to accompany him. Huai'an wielded a solid iron staff weighing a thousand jin, serving as a mighty demon-slaying warrior at the Bodhisattva's side. The Bodhisattva then wrapped the Mirror Lake Robe into a bundle and instructed Huai'an to carry it on his back. Concealing the golden ring, the Bodhisattva took up his copper clapper and set off directly down from Spirit Mountain. This journey would bring about a significant outcome: the Buddha's disciple would return to fulfill his original vow, and Elder Golden Cicada would wrap himself in sandalwood robes.\\n\\nWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain, he was greeted by the Great Immortal of the Golden Summit at Yuzhen Temple, who stood at the temple gate to offer tea. The Bodhisattva dared not linger long and said to the Great Immortal, \\\"I have received the Buddha's command to travel eastward to seek out the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures.\\\" The Great Immortal asked, \\\"When will this pilgrim arrive?\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\"It is uncertain—perhaps within two or three years, or possibly sooner.\\\" With that, he bade farewell to the Great Immortal, traveling through clouds and mist, carefully noting the route along the way. A poem bears witness to this journey:\\n\\n\\\"Seeking across ten thousand miles without a word,\\nWho can claim complete success when desire remains unfulfilled?\\nTo seek others seems so effortless—\\nIs this not fate, destined for me all my life?\\nThe Way is taught with methods, yet without faith, even truth becomes empty rumor.\\nI pledge my heart and soul to find companionship;\\nI know surely ahead lies an encounter meant by destiny.\\\"\\n\\nAs master and disciple continued their journey, they suddenly came upon the Weak Water River, a vast expanse marking the boundary of the Quicksand River. The Bodhisattva remarked:\\n\\n\\\"My disciple, this place proves truly difficult to traverse. How could a mortal with impure flesh and blood possibly cross over?\\\" Huai'an asked, \\\"Master, how far does this river stretch?\\\" As the Bodhisattva paused to gaze, he saw:\\n\\n\\\"To the east it connects with sandy deserts, reaching both eastern and western lands; to the south it extends to Ugo, and to the north it leads to the Tartars. Eight hundred li lie along its length, while its breadth stretches for countless miles. The water flows like the earth turning over, and the waves surge like mountains rising on their backs. Vast and boundless, desolate and endless, its roar echoes for ten li, and its floodwaters rise ten thousand feet high. Even celestial rafts cannot reach here, nor can lotus leaves float upon its surface. Withered grasses bend beneath the slanting sun, yellow clouds obscure the long embankments. Who among merchants dares to travel here? Where do fishermen find shelter? On the flat sands no geese alight, and from distant shores come the cries of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know the beauty of this scene, and the delicate fragrance of white duckweed lingers faintly.\\\"\\n\\nAs the Bodhisattva surveyed the area, a loud splash erupted from the river, and a hideous demon leaped forth from the waters. Its appearance was truly monstrous:\\n\\nIts skin neither green nor black, but dull and gloomy; its body neither tall nor short, barefoot and sinewy. Its eyes gleamed like twin lamps at the hearth, its mouth forked like a butcher's cleaver. Fangs protruded like blades, and fiery hair stood disheveled. It roared like thunder, and its feet moved swiftly as if driven by a rolling wind.\\n\\nThe monster brandished a magical staff and rushed ashore, attempting to seize the Bodhisattva. But Huai'an blocked him with his solid iron club, shouting, \\\"Halt!\\\" The monster raised his staff in response, and the two clashed by the Quicksand River. This fierce battle was truly astonishing:\\n\\nMu Zha's iron club protected the righteous path, displaying divine power; the monster's demon-slaying staff fought valiantly. Two silver serpents danced along the riverbank, and two divine beings charged toward the shore. One wielded might over the Quicksand, demonstrating extraordinary skill; the other defended Guanyin, earning great merit. One leapt and splashed through the waves, while the other spewed mist and clouds. Waves and surges darkened the heavens, mist and clouds dimmed the sun and moon. That demon-slaying staff resembled a white tiger emerging from the mountains; this solid iron club was like a yellow dragon lying in wait. One advanced, parting snakes and stirring grass; the other swung wide, scattering hawks and splitting pines. The battle raged until darkness enveloped everything, stars shone brightly, and mist swirled, blurring heaven and earth. That one had long dwelled in the Weak Water, fierce and relentless; this one achieved his first great feat since leaving Spirit Mountain.\\n\\nThe two fought back and forth for dozens of rounds, evenly matched, with no clear victor. Finally, the monster blocked Mu Zha's iron club and demanded, \\\"Who are you, monk, to dare confront me?\\\" Mu Zha replied, \\\"I am Mu Zha, the Second Prince of the Heavenly King Tota, known as Huai'an the Pilgrim. I now accompany my master on a journey to the Eastern Lands to seek the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures. Who are you, demon, to boldly block our path?\\\" The monster suddenly realized, \\\"I remember you practicing alongside Guanyin of the South Sea in the Bamboo Grove! Why have you come here?\\\" Mu Zha answered, \\\"Isn't that Master standing on the shore?\\\"\\n\\nHearing this, the monster stammered repeatedly, lowered his magical staff, and allowed Mu Zha to lead him before Guanyin. Prostrating himself, he pleaded, \\\"Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and listen to my confession. I am no evil spirit—I am the Scroll-Raising General, an attendant to the imperial carriage in the Celestial Palace.\\\"It was only because I accidentally broke a glass cup during the cricket peach banquet that the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes and banished me to the mortal realm, transforming me into this wretched form. Moreover, every seven days, he commands flying swords to pierce my chest and sides more than a hundred times before withdrawing. Thus, I suffer such torment. With no other choice, driven by unbearable hunger and cold, every two or three days I venture out into the waves to seek passersby for sustenance. Little did I expect today, through ignorance, to have offended the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva. \\n\\nThe Bodhisattva said, \\\"You were guilty in Heaven, and now that you've been cast down, you continue to harm living beings—truly, sin upon sin. I have received Buddha's decree to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. Why don't you join my path, embrace virtuous fruit, become a disciple of that pilgrim, and accompany him westward to pay homage to the Buddha and obtain the sacred texts? Then I shall ensure the flying swords no longer pierce you. Once your mission is accomplished, you'll be absolved of guilt and restored to your original position. What say you?\\\"\\n\\nThe monster replied, \\\"I am willing to embrace the righteous path.\\\" Stepping forward, he said, \\\"Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless humans here, and several pilgrims have passed by, all of whom I've consumed. Every time I ate someone, I tossed their head into the quicksand, where it sank straight to the bottom (a water so deep even goose feathers cannot float). Yet nine pilgrims' skulls floated on the surface, refusing to sink. Thinking them strange objects, I strung them together with a rope and kept them for amusement during idle moments. But now, if the pilgrims never reach this place, wouldn't that only hinder my own future prospects?\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\"How could they possibly fail to arrive? You may hang those skulls above your head as a reminder, waiting patiently for the pilgrims; they will surely prove useful.\\\" The monster said, \\\"If that's the case, I gladly accept your guidance.\\\" The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred the precepts upon him, designated sand as his surname, and thus he became known as Sha Wujing. From that moment, he entered the monastic order, helped the Bodhisattva cross the river, purified his heart and mind, resolved never again to harm living beings, and dedicated himself solely to awaiting the pilgrim.\\n\\nAfter bidding farewell to the monster, the Bodhisattva and Muzha set off directly toward the Eastern lands. After traveling for some time, they came upon another towering mountain shrouded in malevolent energy, making it impossible to climb. Just as they prepared to ride the clouds over the mountain, a sudden gust of wind arose, and another demon appeared. This demon was truly fearsome:\\n\\nHis lips curled upward like lotus petals, his ears resembled giant fans, and his golden eyes gleamed fiercely. His tusks were sharp as steel files, and his gaping mouth seemed like a blazing brazier. A golden helmet tightly secured his cheeks, and armored scales adorned his body like a retreating python. In one hand, he wielded a spiked club resembling a dragon's claw, while a crescent-shaped bow hung from his waist, its ten arrows gleaming brightly. His imposing presence intimidated even the fiercest spirits, and his soaring ambition dwarfed the might of celestial gods. Without hesitation, he charged forward, aiming his spiked club at the Bodhisattva. But Muzha stepped in to block the attack, shouting loudly, \\\"You vile monster, how dare you behave so rudely! Take this!\\\" The demon retorted, \\\"This monk doesn't know when to die! Here's my pitchfork!\\\" And so, beneath the mountain, the two clashed fiercely, battling to decide the victor. It was a truly fierce fight:\\n\\nThe demon was ferocious, yet Hui'an possessed great power. Iron clubs split hearts, and spiked drills met faces head-on. Dust and dirt filled the air, darkening heaven and earth, while flying rocks and debris startled ghosts and gods. The nine-pronged pitchfork gleamed brilliantly, its double rings ringing clearly; the iron staff was sleek and black, soaring through both hands. One was the prince of the Heavenly King, the other a valiant general spirit. One protected the law on Mount Putuo, the other dwelled as a demon in a cave. In this encounter, neither knew who would lose nor who would win.\\n\\nJust as the two were locked in battle, Guanyin appeared in mid-air, tossing down a lotus flower to separate the pitchfork and staff. Startled, the monster asked, \\\"Who are you, monk, daring to play tricks like 'flowers before my eyes' to deceive me?\\\" Muzha replied, \\\"You mere mortal with fleshly eyes! I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. This lotus flower was thrown by my master—you can't even recognize it!\\\" The monster exclaimed, \\\"The Bodhisattva of the South Sea—is that Guanyin, who sweeps away three calamities and rescues from eight tribulations?\\\" Muzha answered, \\\"Who else could it be?\\\" The monster dropped his spiked club, bowed deeply, and said, \\\"Brother, where is the Bodhisattva? Please trouble yourself to introduce me.\\\"\\n\\nMuzha pointed upward and said, \\\"Isn't it right there?\\\" The monster bowed repeatedly toward the sky, crying out loudly, \\\"Bodhisattva, forgive me! Forgive me!\\\"\\n\\nGuanyin descended from the clouds and approached, asking, \\\"What kind of wild boar transformed into a spirit are you, what sort of old pig wreaks havoc here, daring to block my way?\\\" The monster replied, \\\"I am neither a wild boar nor an old pig—I was originally Tianpeng, the Marshal of the Heavenly River.\\\"It was only because I teased Chang'e while drunk that the Jade Emperor struck me with two thousand hammer blows and banished me to the mortal realm. My true spirit, in a misguided attempt at rebirth, mistakenly entered the womb of a sow, resulting in this monstrous form. I bit and killed the sow, slaughtered the entire herd of pigs, and seized this mountain territory, surviving by preying on humans. Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered you, Bodhisattva—please, I beg you, save me! Tassa asked, “What is the name of this mountain?” The monster replied, “It’s called Mount Fuleng. Within the mountain lies a cave known as Yunzhan Cave. Originally, there lived a woman named Egg Sister Two inside that cave. Seeing that I had some martial skills, she made me the head of the household and even nicknamed me ‘Inverted Gate.’ But less than a year later, she died, leaving all her possessions to me. Now, after living here for so long, I have no meaningful occupation.” The Bodhisattva said, “As the ancients taught: ‘If you wish for a future, avoid actions that lead to none.’ You broke the laws of Heaven above, yet still refuse to abandon your violent nature, harming living beings and creating karma. Isn’t that committing two offenses at once?” The monster retorted, “A future? A future! If I followed your advice, I’d be left to starve! As the saying goes: ‘Obeying official law means being beaten to death; obeying Buddhist law means starving to death.’ Go away! Go away! It’s better to catch a traveler and feast on his fatty flesh! Who cares about two sins, three sins, a thousand sins, ten thousand sins!” The Bodhisattva replied, “‘Heaven responds to sincere human wishes.’ If you’re willing to turn to the righteous path, there will surely be a place for you to sustain yourself. The world has five grains; they can all satisfy hunger—why must you survive by eating people?” Upon hearing this, the monster seemed to awaken from a dream and said to the Bodhisattva, “I want to follow the right path, but how can I when ‘to offend Heaven leaves no prayer unanswered’?” The Bodhisattva continued, “I’ve received Buddha’s command to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. You could become his disciple and accompany him on a journey westward, redeeming your sins through merit, and I’ll ensure you escape this calamity.” The monster eagerly agreed, exclaiming, “I’m willing! I’m willing!” The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred upon him the precepts, assigned him the surname Zhu (Pig), gave him the Dharma name Zhu Wuneng, and instructed him to observe vegetarian vows, renouncing the five pungent vegetables and the three forbidden meats, patiently awaiting the arrival of the pilgrim. After parting ways with Mutza, the Bodhisattva and Mutza rose into the clouds, traveling onward, when suddenly they saw a jade dragon crying out in mid-air. Approaching it, the Bodhisattva asked, “Who are you, dragon, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon replied, “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I set fire to the luminous pearl in the palace, my father reported me to Heaven, accusing me of rebellion. The Five Emperors hung me in mid-air and beat me three hundred times, and soon I’ll be executed. Please, Bodhisattva, save me!” Hearing this, Guanyin immediately rushed with Mutza toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. There, the two celestial masters, Qiu and Zhang, greeted them and asked, “Where are you headed?” The Bodhisattva replied, “This humble monk wishes to see the Jade Emperor.” The two masters quickly reported the request, and the Jade Emperor descended from his throne to welcome them. After paying respects, the Bodhisattva said, “I’ve been sent by Buddha to seek the pilgrim in the Eastern Lands. On my way, I encountered a wicked dragon hanging here, and I’ve come specifically to petition for mercy, asking that his life be spared and entrusted to me, so he may serve as a mount for the pilgrim.” Upon hearing this, the Five Emperors immediately issued an edict of pardon, ordering a heavenly general to release the dragon and deliver him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva expressed gratitude and departed. The little dragon prostrated himself, thanking the Bodhisattva for saving his life, and pledged obedience to her commands. The Bodhisattva placed him deep in a ravine, where he would wait for the pilgrim to arrive, transforming into a white horse and earning merit in the West. The little dragon accepted the order and quietly disappeared. Leading Mutza, the Bodhisattva continued her journey across this mountain and onward toward the Eastern Lands. Not long after, they suddenly saw countless golden rays of light and auspicious vapors rising in thousands of streams. Mutza exclaimed, “Master, that shining place must be the Five Elements Mountain, where the Buddha’s ‘seal’ is affixed!” The Bodhisattva confirmed, “Indeed, that’s the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who once disrupted the Peach Banquet and caused chaos in the Heavenly Palace—he now lies imprisoned beneath this seal.” Mutza agreed, “Exactly, exactly!” Master and disciple climbed the mountain together and gazed upon the inscription, which read the six-syllable mantra: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” After examining it, the Bodhisattva sighed deeply and composed a poem, which reads:  \\nHow pitiful that the mischievous monkey defied authority,  \\nOnce reckless and bold, flaunting heroic might.  \\nDeceitful, he disrupted the Peach Banquet,  \\nDaringly intruded upon the Tuishou Palace.  \\nUnrivaled among ten thousand soldiers,  \\nHis might resounded through the nine heavens.  \\nNow trapped by our Buddha Shakyamuni,  \\nWhen will he stretch forth again and display his glory?  \\nWhile master and disciple were speaking, the Great Sage was already alerted.Da Sheng stood at the foot of the mountain and shouted loudly,  \\n“Who is it up there on the hill, reciting poetry and exposing my flaws?”  \\nUpon hearing this, the Bodhisattva immediately descended the mountain to investigate. Below the rocky cliff, they found the local deity, the mountain god, and the celestial generals who had been guarding the Great Sage—all coming forward to greet the Bodhisattva and escort them before the Great Sage himself. When they looked closely, they saw that he was trapped inside a stone casket, able to speak but unable to move. The Bodhisattva asked, “Hey you with the surname Sun, do you recognize me?”  \\nThe Great Sage opened his fiery golden eyes, nodded vigorously, and cried out, “How could I not know you? You are indeed the compassionate and merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo in the South Sea, who saves those in distress and hardship. Thank you for your kindness! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been spending each day here like an eternity, with not a single acquaintance to visit me. But pray tell, where have you come from?”  \\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “I was sent by the Buddha’s decree to journey eastward in search of someone to retrieve scriptures. Passing by here, I paused briefly to check on you.”  \\nThe Great Sage said, “The Buddha deceived me, trapping me beneath this mountain for over five hundred years, unable to break free. I earnestly beg you, great Bodhisattva, to show me some mercy and rescue old Sun once and for all!”  \\nThe Bodhisattva responded, “Your sins run deep. If I were to free you now, I fear you’d only cause more trouble—such an outcome would hardly be commendable.”  \\nThe Great Sage insisted, “I’ve already repented deeply. Please, great compassionate one, point me toward a path of redemption, and I’ll willingly devote myself to cultivation.”  \\nAnd so it came to pass:  \\n“A single thought arises in the human heart, and heaven and earth take note. If good and evil remain unpunished, surely heaven and earth must harbor bias.”  \\nHearing these words, the Bodhisattva felt immense joy and said to the Great Sage, “As the scriptures say: ‘Speak kindly, and distant lands will respond; speak unkindly, and distant lands will recoil.’ Since you’ve shown such sincerity, when I reach the Tang Empire in the East, I’ll find someone tasked with retrieving scriptures and instruct him to rescue you. You can become his disciple, uphold the teachings, and enter the Buddhist fold. Then we can work together toward enlightenment. What do you say?”  \\nThe Great Sage exclaimed loudly, “I accept! I accept!”  \\nThe Bodhisattva continued, “Since you’ve shown such virtue, let me give you a Dharma name.”  \\nThe Great Sage replied, “I already have a name—I’m called Sun Wukong.”  \\nThe Bodhisattva happily added, “Two others have previously taken refuge under the character ‘Wu’—you too shall bear that character, perfectly aligning with them. How wonderful, how wonderful! There’s no need for further reminders; I shall depart now.”  \\nThus, the Great Sage, having realized his true nature, returned wholeheartedly to Buddhism, while the Bodhisattva lingered, mindful of her divine mission.  \\nTogether with Mutzha, they set off eastward, arriving without delay in Chang’an, the capital of the Tang Empire. As mist cleared and clouds dispersed, master and disciple transformed into two ragged, leprous monks, entering the city of Chang’an unnoticed, unaware that evening had already fallen. Walking along the main market street, they spotted a local deity shrine and stepped right inside, startling the local deity and sending the ghostly soldiers into trembling fear. Realizing it was the Bodhisattva, the deity quickly prostrated himself in reverence. Hastily, the local deity ran to inform the City God, the district magistrate, and all the deities of every temple throughout Chang’an, who promptly gathered to pay their respects, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our tardiness in welcoming you.”  \\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “You must not reveal this news. I’ve come here specifically by the Buddha’s command to seek out someone who will retrieve scriptures. I’ll temporarily stay in your temple for a few days, until I find the true monk, then I’ll return.”  \\nAll the deities returned to their respective posts, and the local deity was hurriedly relocated to the City God’s temple for temporary residence, while the master and disciple concealed their true forms.  \\nFor now, we don’t yet know whether they’ll succeed in finding the scripture seeker. Tune in next time to find out.  \\nTable of Contents, Appendix: Chen Guangrui Sets Off for Office and Encounters Disaster; Jiangliu Monk Takes Revenge to Restore His Roots.  \\nNow, let us speak of Chang’an, the great capital of Shaanxi Province, a city built as the imperial seat by emperors of past dynasties. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han eras, the three districts have blossomed like brocade, and eight rivers flow around the city, truly making it a land of scenic wonders. At this time, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Zhenguan, and had already reigned for thirteen years, in the year of Ji Si. The realm enjoyed peace, tribute flowed in from all directions, and the four seas acknowledged his sovereignty. One day, Emperor Taizong convened all civil and military officials, and after the morning ceremony concluded, Prime Minister Wei Zheng stepped forward and reported, “Today the realm is peaceful, and tranquility prevails in all directions. In accordance with ancient custom, we should open examination halls, recruit talented individuals, and promote capable people to serve in governance.”  \\nEmperor Taizong said,  \\n“What you propose, esteemed minister, is entirely reasonable.”  \\nAnd so he issued a notice calling for talented scholars, proclaiming throughout the empire: all prefectures, provinces, and counties, regardless of whether they were military or civilian, anyone among the literati who possessed clear understanding of classical texts and excelled in the three examinations, should travel to Chang’an to take the test.When the imperial edict reached the region of Haizhou, a man named Chen Guangrui, with the courtesy name E, saw it and immediately returned home. He said to his mother, Lady Zhang, \\\"The court has issued a yellow proclamation, calling for talented individuals from southern provinces to take the examinations. I intend to go and compete. If I can secure even a minor official post, it will bring honor and fame to my family, ensure prosperity for my wife and children, and bring glory to our household—this is my greatest ambition. I am informing you of my decision before I depart.\\\" Lady Zhang replied, \\\"My son, as a scholar, you should indeed 'study in youth and act in adulthood.' That is exactly how it should be. But when you go to take the exams, you must be careful along the way, and once you obtain an official position, return home promptly.\\\" Guangrui then instructed his servants to pack his belongings, bid farewell to his mother, and set off on his journey without delay. Upon arriving in Chang'an, he found that the examination grounds were already open, so he entered the competition. After passing the preliminary tests and successfully completing the three policy essays in the imperial court examination, Emperor Tang personally bestowed upon him the title of zhuangyuan (top scholar) and awarded him a horse to ride through the streets for three days. Unexpectedly, during his parade, he passed by the residence of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, whose only daughter, Wen Jiao, also known as Mantang Jiao, had not yet married. She was standing atop a beautifully decorated pavilion, tossing a silk ball to select her husband. As Chen Guangrui happened to pass below, the young lady caught sight of his outstanding appearance and recognized him as the newly crowned zhuangyuan. Overjoyed, she threw down the silk ball, which landed squarely on Guangrui's black official cap. Suddenly, a gentle melody of flutes and strings filled the air, and more than ten maids descended from the pavilion, leading Guangrui's horse and escorting him into the prime minister's mansion to celebrate their wedding. The prime minister and his wife immediately came out to greet the guests, officiated the ceremony, and formally betrothed the young lady to Guangrui. They bowed to heaven and earth, exchanged vows as husband and wife, and paid respects to the bride's parents. The prime minister then ordered a banquet to be prepared, and they celebrated joyfully throughout the night.\\n\\nThe two held hands tenderly as they entered the bridal chamber. The next morning, at the third watch of the day, Emperor Taizong took his seat in the Golden Hall, surrounded by civil and military officials who had gathered for court. Taizong asked, \\\"What official position should be granted to the newly appointed zhuangyuan, Chen Guangrui?\\\" Prime Minister Wei Zheng replied, \\\"Your servant has examined the available vacancies in various prefectures and counties and found that Jiangzhou currently has an unoccupied post. I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint him to this position.\\\" Taizong immediately agreed and appointed Guangrui as governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to prepare for departure without delay. Guangrui expressed his gratitude, left the palace, returned to the prime minister's residence, discussed the matter with his wife, bid farewell to his in-laws, and set off with his wife toward Jiangzhou to assume his new post.\\n\\nAs they left Chang'an, the weather was late spring, with gentle breezes turning the willows green and fine rain sprinkling red blossoms. Upon arriving home, Guangrui and his wife paid their respects to Lady Zhang. Lady Zhang said, \\\"Congratulations, my son! You've not only succeeded in the examinations but have also brought your bride home.\\\" Guangrui replied, \\\"It is entirely due to your blessings, Mother, that I was fortunate enough to become zhuangyuan, received the imperial procession through the streets, and encountered the silk ball toss in front of Prime Minister Yin's residence, where I was chosen as his daughter's husband. Now the court has appointed me governor of Jiangzhou, and I have come to fetch you so we may all travel together to take up my post.\\\" Lady Zhang was overjoyed and began preparing for the journey. After several days on the road, they arrived at Liu Xiao'er's inn near Wanhuadian. Suddenly, Lady Zhang fell ill, and she said to Guangrui, \\\"I'm feeling unwell. Let's rest here for two days to recover before continuing.\\\" Guangrui obeyed her wishes. The following morning, he noticed a man selling a golden carp outside the inn. Guangrui bought it for one guan, intending to cook it for his mother. But as he looked closer, he saw that the fish blinked its eyes mysteriously. Astonished, Guangrui exclaimed, \\\"I've heard that fish and snakes blink their eyes—it surely can't be an ordinary creature!\\\" He then asked the fisherman, \\\"Where did you catch this fish?\\\" The fisherman replied, \\\"Fifteen li from the city, in the Hongjiang River.\\\" Guangrui immediately released the fish back into the river. Returning to the inn, he told his mother about it, and she said, \\\"Releasing living creatures is a virtuous deed, and I'm very pleased.\\\" Guangrui added, \\\"We've already stayed here for three days, and time is pressing. I plan to leave tomorrow, but I wonder if you're well enough to travel?\\\" Lady Zhang answered, \\\"I'm not feeling well, and the heat along the road might worsen my condition. Why don't you rent a house here temporarily while I stay behind? Leave some money with me, and you two can go ahead to take up your post. I'll join you when the autumn coolness arrives.\\\" Guangrui consulted with his wife, rented a house, gave his mother some funds, and bid them both farewell.\\n\\nThe journey was arduous, with days of travel and nights spent in lodging, and soon they reached the Hongjiang ferry crossing. There, they found Liu Hong and Li Biao waiting to guide them across the river. It seemed that Guangrui's past karma had destined him to encounter these ill-fated individuals.Guangrui ordered his servant to carry their luggage aboard the boat. As husband and wife were about to board together, Liu Hong opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin: her face was as bright as the full moon, her eyes like autumn waters, her lips cherry-red, and her waist slender as a willow branch—indeed possessing beauty enough to make fish sink and wild geese fall from the sky, a countenance so dazzling it could shame the moon and blush flowers. Instantly consumed by wolfish intent, he conspired with Li Biao, steering the boat to an uninhabited stretch of water. When midnight struck, they first killed the servant, then beat Guangrui to death, dumping both bodies into the river. Seeing her husband slain, the young lady prepared to throw herself into the water as well. But Liu Hong grabbed her tightly, saying, “If you yield to me, all will be forgiven! If not, I’ll cut you down right here!” With no other choice, the lady reluctantly agreed, submitting to Liu Hong for the time being. The villain then rowed the boat to the southern shore, handing it over to Li Biao to manage, while he himself donned Guangrui’s attire and official credentials, taking the lady with him to assume his post in Jiangzhou.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the body of the murdered servant drifted downstream with the current, but Guangrui’s corpse sank to the bottom and remained motionless. A sea demon patrolling near the mouth of the Hong River happened to notice it and immediately reported to the Dragon King’s palace. At that very moment, the Dragon King was presiding over court when the demon reported: “Today, near the mouth of the Hong River, someone unknown has beaten to death a scholar and left his body at the bottom of the water.” The Dragon King ordered the body to be brought forth and examined closely. Upon inspection, he declared, “This man is none other than my savior! How could he have been murdered? As the saying goes, one repays kindness with kindness. Today, I must save his life to repay the favor he once showed me.” He immediately penned an official decree and dispatched the demon straight to the City God and Land Deity of Hongzhou, instructing them to retrieve the scholar’s soul and restore his life.\\n\\nThe City God and Land Deity summoned a little ghost to deliver Chen Guangrui’s soul to the demon, who carried it to the Crystal Palace and presented it to the Dragon King. The Dragon King asked, “Young scholar, what is your name and family name? Where are you from? Why did you come here, only to be murdered?” Guangrui bowed respectfully and replied, “I am Chen E, courtesy name Guangrui, from Hongnong County, Haizhou. I was fortunate enough to become the top scholar in the recent imperial examinations and appointed governor of Jiangzhou. On my way to take up my post with my wife, we boarded a boat by the riverbank, only to be betrayed by the villain Liu Hong, who coveted my wife and murdered me, casting my body into the water. Great King, please save me!” Hearing this, the Dragon King said, “So it is! Sir, the golden carp you released earlier was none other than myself. You saved my life, and now that you’re in trouble, how could I possibly refuse to help?” He then had Guangrui’s body placed aside, inserting a magical bead into his mouth to preserve it intact, so that one day it could regain its spirit and seek vengeance. He added, “For now, your true soul shall temporarily serve as a chief official in my underwater realm.” Guangrui bowed deeply in gratitude, and the Dragon King hosted a banquet in his honor, which need not be detailed further.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin loathed Liu the villain with every fiber of her being, wishing she could devour his flesh and flay his skin—but pregnant as she was, unsure whether the child was a boy or girl, she had no choice but to endure and comply for the time being. Before she knew it, they had arrived in Jiangzhou. Officials, clerks, and servants all came out to greet them. Local dignitaries arranged a grand banquet in the courthouse to celebrate. Liu Hong said, “My arrival here today is entirely due to your generous support.” The officials replied, “Your Excellency is highly talented and virtuous; naturally, you treat the people as your own children, keeping lawsuits simple and punishments light. We, your subordinates, are fortunate indeed—why be so modest?” After the banquet concluded, everyone dispersed.\\n\\nTime passed swiftly. One day, Liu Hong had urgent business far away, leaving the lady alone in the official residence, longing for her mother-in-law and husband. Sitting in the flower pavilion, she sighed deeply, suddenly feeling weary, with pain in her abdomen, and fainting to the ground. Unbeknownst to her, she gave birth to a son. Suddenly, a voice whispered in her ear: “Beloved daughter-in-law, heed my words carefully. I am the Star Lord of the South Pole, sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva’s command specifically to entrust this child to you. In the future, he will achieve great fame and distinction, far beyond the ordinary. When Liu the villain returns, he will surely harm this child, so you must protect him diligently. Your husband has already been rescued by the Dragon King; someday, husband and wife will reunite, mother and son will be reunited, and justice will finally be served. Remember my words well—wake up, wake up!” Having spoken these words, the voice vanished. The lady awoke, recalling every word clearly, clutching her child tightly, yet feeling utterly helpless. Suddenly, Liu Hong returned and, upon seeing the child, immediately tried to drown him. The lady quickly said, “It’s already late today; let’s wait until tomorrow to throw him into the river.” Fortunately, early the next morning, Liu Hong received urgent orders to leave on another distant errand. Secretly, the lady thought, “If we wait until the villain returns, this child’s life will be lost! Better to abandon him in the river now and let fate decide his destiny.”\\\"If Heaven takes pity on us and someone rescues this child, raising him as their own, perhaps we shall meet again someday.\\\" But fearing it might be difficult to recognize him later, she bit her finger until it bled, writing a blood letter detailing her parents' names, origins, and the full story of their plight. She then bit off the little toe from the child's left foot, using it as a distinctive mark. Taking a close-fitting undershirt, she wrapped the baby in it and, seizing an opportune moment, carried him out of the official residence. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, so the young lady hurried to the riverside and burst into tears. Just as she was about to abandon the child, she suddenly noticed a wooden plank drifting lazily along the riverbank. Bowing toward the heavens in prayer, she carefully placed the baby onto the plank, secured him with a strap, tied the blood letter to his chest, and gently pushed the makeshift raft into the river, letting fate guide its course. With tears streaming down her face, she returned to the residence without further ado.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the child floated downstream on the wooden plank, drifting steadily until he came to rest at the foot of Jinshan Temple. The abbot of Jinshan Temple was a venerable monk named Faming, who had attained profound enlightenment through spiritual cultivation and mastered the subtle secrets of immortality. While meditating in deep contemplation, he suddenly heard the cries of a baby. His heart stirred, and he hurried to the riverside, where he saw a tiny infant sleeping peacefully on a piece of driftwood. Hastily, he rescued the child and, upon examining the blood letter clutched in the baby's hand, learned of his origins. He gave the child a nickname, Jiangliu, entrusted him to others for care, and carefully preserved the blood letter as a precious keepsake. Time flew by like an arrow, days and months passing swiftly, and before anyone realized it, Jiangliu had grown into an eighteen-year-old youth. The abbot then called him forward, shaved his head, and ordained him as a monk, giving him the Dharma name Xuanzang. After receiving the precepts and having his head touched, Xuanzang resolved firmly to pursue the path of enlightenment.\\n\\nOne day, during the late spring season, everyone gathered beneath the shade of pine trees to listen to sutras, engage in meditation, and discuss profound teachings. At that very moment, a dissolute monk who indulged in meat and wine found himself utterly confounded by Xuanzang. Enraged, the monk lashed out, shouting, \\\"You wretched creature! You don't even know your own name or your parents—what right do you have to meddle here?\\\" Hearing such harsh words, Xuanzang knelt before his master in the temple, tears streaming down his face, and pleaded earnestly: \\\"All beings are born between heaven and earth, nourished by yin and yang and sustained by the five elements. It is only natural that one is born of a father and raised by a mother. How can there be a person in this world without parents?\\\" He continued to implore his master repeatedly, begging to learn the names of his parents. The abbot finally said, \\\"If you truly wish to find your parents, come with me to my quarters.\\\" Xuanzang followed him to the abbot's chamber, where the elder climbed up to the rafters, retrieved a small box, and opened it to reveal the blood letter and the undershirt, handing them over to Xuanzang. As Xuanzang unfolded the blood letter and read it carefully, he finally learned the full details of his parents' names and the tragic circumstances surrounding their wrongful deaths. Upon finishing the reading, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly: \\\"How can I call myself human if I cannot avenge my parents' wrongs? For eighteen years, I've lived without knowing my birth parents, and only today do I discover that I have a mother. Had it not been for my master rescuing and nurturing me, how could I stand here today? Please allow me to go seek out my mother, and afterward, I will carry incense bowls on my head, rebuild the temple, and repay my master's immense kindness!\\\"\\n\\nThe master replied, \\\"If you wish to find your mother, take this blood letter and undershirt with you. Simply beg alms as you travel directly to the private residence in Jiangzhou, and there you shall surely meet your mother.\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang accepted his master's instructions, disguised himself as a mendicant monk, and set off straight for Jiangzhou. Coincidentally, Liu Hong happened to be away on business, and fate seemed to bring mother and son together. Xuanzang arrived at the gate of the private residence, chanting sutras and calling out, \\\"Alms, please!\\\" Lady Yin, meanwhile, had dreamt the previous night of a waning moon that had fully regained its roundness. She mused to herself, \\\"My mother-in-law remains missing, my husband was murdered by bandits, and my son was cast into the river. If someone has adopted him, he must now be eighteen years old. Perhaps today, heaven has arranged for us to meet again—it cannot be mere coincidence.\\\" As she pondered these thoughts, she suddenly heard someone chanting sutras outside the residence, calling out, \\\"Alms, please!\\\" Seizing the opportunity, she stepped out and asked, \\\"From where do you come?\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang replied, \\\"I am a humble monk, a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple.\\\"\\n\\nLady Yin exclaimed, \\\"So you are indeed a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple—\\\" and invited him inside, offering him a meal. As she observed his demeanor and speech closely, she noticed a striking resemblance to her late husband. She dismissed her maidservants and asked, \\\"Young master, did you become a monk from childhood, or did you enter the monastic life later in life? What is your full name, and do you still have living parents?\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang answered, \\\"I did not become a monk in childhood, nor did I enter the priesthood in middle age. To tell you the truth, my grievances are as vast as the sky, and my hatred runs as deep as the sea! My father was treacherously murdered, and my mother was taken by bandits. My master, Abbot Faming, instructed me to come to the Jiangzhou residence and search for my mother.\\\"\\n\\nLady Yin asked, \\\"What is your mother's surname?\\\"\\n\\nXuanzang replied, \\\"My mother's surname is Yin, her given name is Wenjiao; my father's surname is Chen, his given name is Guangrui; my childhood nickname was Jiangliu, and my Dharma name is Xuanzang.\\\"\\n\\nLady Yin declared, \\\"Wenjiao—that is me! But what proof do you have to support your claim?\\\"Upon hearing that it was his mother, Xuanzang dropped to his knees and burst into tears: “If my mother doesn’t believe me, here’s proof—a blood-written undershirt!” Wenjiao took the undershirt and examined it carefully; sure enough, it was genuine. Mother and son embraced each other, weeping bitterly, and she urged him, “My son, hurry and leave at once!” Xuanzang replied, “For eighteen years I’ve never known my birth parents, and only today have I finally met my mother—how can I bear to part from her?” The young lady said, “My son, you must quickly make your escape! If Liu the bandit returns, he’ll surely take your life! Tomorrow I’ll pretend to fall ill, claiming that years ago I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk’s shoes, and I’ll come to your temple to fulfill that vow. At that time, I’ll have something important to tell you.” Xuanzang, following her advice, bowed farewell.\\n\\nNow, ever since seeing her son, the young lady had been filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry. One day, she suddenly feigned illness, refusing food and drink, and lay down in bed. When Liu Hong returned to the office and asked about the reason, she said, “When I was young, I made a vow to donate one hundred pairs of monk’s shoes. Five days ago, I dreamt of a monk holding a sharp blade, demanding those shoes, and ever since then I’ve felt unwell.” Liu Hong exclaimed, “Why didn’t you mention such a trivial matter earlier?” He immediately ordered Wang Zuo Ya and Li You Ya to convene in court: all households in Jiangzhou city were instructed to prepare one pair of monk’s shoes each, with a deadline of five days for completion. The people dutifully fulfilled the order. Then the young lady turned to Liu Hong and asked, “Now that the monk’s shoes are ready, which temple would be suitable for me to go and fulfill my vow?” Liu Hong replied, “In Jiangzhou there’s Jinshan Temple and Jiaoshan Temple—whichever temple you prefer, you may choose.” The young lady said, “I’ve long heard that Jinshan Temple is an excellent monastery, so I shall go there.” Liu Hong immediately summoned Wang and Li, ordering them to prepare a boat.\\n\\nThe young lady brought along her trusted attendants, boarded the boat, and as soon as the oars pushed off, they headed straight for Jinshan Temple.\\n\\nMeanwhile, back at the temple, Xuanzang reported everything to Elder Faming, who was overjoyed upon hearing the tale.\\n\\nThe next day, a maid arrived first, announcing that the lady had come to the temple to fulfill her vow. All the monks came out to greet her.\\n\\nThe young lady walked directly through the temple gates, paid homage to the Bodhisattva, and arranged a grand vegetarian feast. She then instructed her maids to place the monk’s shoes and socks on a tray. When she reached the main hall, she again lit incense and offered prayers, after which she asked Elder Faming to distribute the offerings among the monks. Once the monks had dispersed and the hall was empty, Xuanzang knelt forward. The young lady asked him to remove his shoes and socks, and indeed, a small toe was missing from his left foot. At that moment, the two embraced once more, weeping uncontrollably, and expressed their gratitude to the elder for raising him. Faming said, “Now that mother and son have reunited, there’s a risk that the villain might find out. You must quickly withdraw before disaster strikes.” The young lady added, “My son, I’m giving you this ring as a token. Head northwest toward Hongzhou, a journey of roughly fifteen hundred li. There, in Wanhuadian, you’ll find Granny Zhang, your father’s own mother. I’ve also written you a letter to deliver to the imperial palace in Tang’s capital, to the home of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, on the left side of the Golden Hall—those are your maternal grandparents. Hand my letter to your grandfather, and ask him to petition the Tang emperor, gather troops, capture this villain, avenge your father, and only then will your mother’s life be saved. I dare not linger here any longer, for fear that the villain might suspect me if I return late.” With that, she left the temple, boarded the boat, and departed.\\n\\nXuanzang returned to the temple, weeping, and informed his master before bidding farewell immediately, heading straight for Hongzhou. Upon arriving at Wanhuadian, he asked the shopkeeper, Liu Xia’er, “Years ago, a guest named Chen from Jiangzhou stayed at your inn with his mother. How is she doing now?” Liu Xia’er replied, “She did stay at my inn, but later her eyesight failed, and for three or four years she didn’t pay me rent. Now she lives in a dilapidated kiln near the South Gate, begging daily on the streets to survive. That guest left long ago, and since then we’ve had no news of him whatsoever—no one knows why.” Upon hearing this, Xuanzang immediately went to the South Gate and found the old woman living in the broken kiln. The old woman exclaimed, “Your voice sounds just like my son, Chen Guangrui!” Xuanzang replied, “I’m not Chen Guangrui—I’m his son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother.” The old woman asked, “Why haven’t your parents come?” Xuanzang answered, “My father was beaten to death by bandits, and my mother was taken by force as their wife.” The old woman continued, “How did you know to come looking for me?” Xuanzang explained, “My mother sent me to find you. She gave me a letter and a ring.” The old woman took the letter and the ring, bursting into tears as she cried out, “My son came all this way for fame and success—I thought he’d betrayed us and forgotten his kindness, never imagining he’d been murdered!”And I am glad that the emperor has pity on me. After my son, today there are grandchildren looking for me.\\\" Xuanzang asked, \\\"Why are your mother-in-law's eyes faint?\\\" The mother-in-law said, \\\"I cried so hard that my eyes fainted because I thought about your father all day long and I didn't see him coming.\\\" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the Sky: \\\"Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and his parents' hatred cannot be avenged. Today, I took my mother's order to find my mother-in-law. If the sky shows my disciple's sincerity, I will keep my mother-in-law's eyes clear!\\\" After wishing, he licked the tip of his tongue and his mother-in-law's eyes. In a moment, my eyes lick open and still return to the same place. The mother-in-law looked at the young monk and said, \\\\n \\\"You are my grandson! It's just like my son Guang Rui!\\\" The mother-in-law was happy and sad. Xuanzang took her mother-in-law out of the kiln door, went to Liu Xiaoer's shop, and put some money in a house to live with her mother-in-law. Then she entangled herself with her mother-in-law and said, \\\"I'll be back in less than a month.\\\" \\\\n Then he quit his mother-in-law and headed for the capital. He found Prime Minister Yin's Mansion on Huangcheng East Street and said to the door, \\\"The little monk is a relative. Come to visit Xianggong.\\\" The door was informed of the prime minister, who said, \\\"I have no relatives with the monk.\\\" The wife said, \\\"I dreamed last night that my daughter came home full of charming, unless my son-in-law came back with letters.\\\" The Prime Minister then taught the young monk to come to the hall. When the young monk saw the Prime Minister and his wife, he cried and bowed to the ground. He took out a book from his arms and handed it to the prime minister. The Prime Minister opened it, read it from the beginning, and cried bitterly. The lady asked, \\\"What was the accident?\\\" The Prime Minister said, \\\"This Monk is my nephew and yours. Son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by thieves, and Mantang Jiao was forcibly taken as his wife by thieves.\\\" Madame listened and cried bitterly. The Prime Minister said: \\\"Madam is worried. Come to the court to tell the Lord and personally command the troops. You must avenge your son-in-law.\\\" \\\\n The next day, the prime minister entered the dynasty and inspired the Tang King to say: \\\"Today, Chen Guangrui, the top scholar of his son-in-law, led his family Xiaojiang to take office. He was killed by Liu Hong, a little water, and took his daughter as his wife. He pretended to be a son-in-law and became an official for many years. This is a change. His Majesty beggars immediately sent troops to eliminate thieves.\\\" When the King of the Tang Dynasty saw that he was furious, he sent 60,000 Imperial troops to the Prime Minister Yin to supervise the soldiers. The Prime Minister led the decree out of the court, that is, he ordered soldiers to the teaching ground and headed for Jiangzhou. Xiao Xing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, but he did not realize he had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's soldiers and horses all went down to camp on the north bank. Starry night ordered the gold medal to be called to Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state sentenced two people. The Prime Minister told him that he knew about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before the sky was clear, Liu Hong's Yamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the Golden Drums were ringing, and the soldiers killed into the private office. Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured early. The Prime Minister handed down a military order to tie Liu Hong and his men to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city. \\\\n The Prime Minister went straight into the main hall of the government office and sat down. Please ask the young lady to come out and meet. If the young lady wants to stay and go out, she will hang herself if she is ashamed of her father. Hearing this, Xuanzang hurriedly rescued his mother, knelt down on his knees and said to his mother, \\\"Son and grandfather, unify the troops here and avenge your father. Today, the thief has been captured. Why did my mother want to die? If the mother dies, how can the child survive?\\\" The Prime Minister also went to the government to persuade him. The young lady said, \\\"I heard that the woman died from one thing. Tongfu has been killed by thieves, how can he be ashamed of being a thief? Because of the posthumous body, had to endure shame to steal life. Today, Xing'er has grown up and seen his old father take revenge for his daughter. What will he see! Only death can repay her husband's ear!\\\" \\\\n The Prime Minister said: \\\"This is not my son's change of course with ups and downs. It is all because of a last resort. Why should I be ashamed!\\\" Father and son hugged and cried, and Xuanzang also mourned. The Prime Minister wiped away his tears and said, \\\"You two should stop worrying. I have captured the enemy thief now, and I will send it off.\\\" That is, I got up and went to the Dharma Field. It happened that Jiangzhou Tongzhi also sent sentinels to take the water thief Li Biao.The prime minister was overjoyed and immediately ordered the soldiers to bring Liu Hong and Li Biao forward. Each was flogged severely with one hundred strokes, after which they confessed under duress, admitting their conspiracy years ago to murder Chen Guangrui. First, Li Biao was nailed onto a wooden donkey, dragged to the marketplace, and executed by being sliced into a thousand pieces, his head then displayed publicly as a warning. Next, Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang ferry crossing, the very spot where he had killed Chen Guangrui years ago. The prime minister, accompanied by the young lady and Xuanzang, personally went to the riverside, offering prayers toward the heavens. They then cruelly gouged out Liu Hong's heart and liver, using them as offerings for Guangrui, and burned a memorial text as part of the ritual.\\n\\nThe three stood by the river weeping bitterly, an act that soon alarmed the underwater realm. A sea patrol Yaksha quickly presented the memorial text to the Dragon King. After reading it, the Dragon King dispatched General Bie Wu to summon Guangrui. \\\"Sir,\\\" said the Dragon King, \\\"congratulations! Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all at the riverside paying tribute to you. I shall now restore your soul. Moreover, I offer you one如意珠, two walking beads, ten lengths of fine silk, and a beaded jade belt. Today, you shall finally reunite with your wife, child, and mother.\\\" Guangrui bowed repeatedly in gratitude. The Dragon King then instructed the Yaksha to carry Guangrui's body out of the river mouth and restore his soul. The Yaksha accepted the order and departed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin had finished mourning her husband and was about to throw herself into the water to end her life, but Xuanzang desperately grabbed hold of her, preventing her from doing so. In the midst of this chaos, suddenly a corpse floated up on the water's surface, drifting close to the riverbank. Miss Yin hurried forward to examine it and recognized her husband's body, bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone gathered around to watch, and they saw Guangrui slowly stretching his fists and legs, his body gradually coming back to life. Suddenly, he sat up, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Guangrui opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin, his father-in-law Prime Minister Yin, and the little monk all weeping beside him. Guangrui asked, \\\"Why are you all here?\\\" Miss Yin replied, \\\"Because you were murdered by bandits, and later I gave birth to our son. Fortunately, he was raised by the abbot of Jinshan Temple and eventually found me. I sent him to seek out your father, who learned of your fate and petitioned the court. He led troops here, captured the bandits, and just now, they took your heart and liver as offerings to you. I never imagined you would come back to life!\\\" Guangrui explained, \\\"It's all because years ago, when we were at the Wanhuadeng shop, I bought and released that golden carp. Little did I know that carp was actually the Dragon King of these waters. When the villain pushed me into the river, it was thanks to him that I survived. Now he has restored my soul and bestowed upon me these treasures. And I never expected you to give birth to our son, nor that my father-in-law would avenge me. Truly, after enduring so much hardship, sweet happiness has finally arrived—a joy beyond measure!\\\"\\n\\nUpon hearing the news, all the officials came to congratulate them. The prime minister ordered a banquet to be prepared, thanking his subordinates before the army began its return journey. Arriving at Wanhuadeng, the prime minister ordered the troops to set up camp. Guangrui, accompanied by Xuanzang, went to Liu's shop to find his mother-in-law. That night, she had a dream: a withered tree blossomed, and magpies chirped incessantly behind her house. She thought, \\\"Could it be my grandson returning?\\\" Before she could finish her thoughts, Guangrui and his son appeared at the door. The little monk pointed and said, \\\"Isn't that my grandmother?\\\" Upon seeing his aged mother, Guangrui immediately knelt down and prostrated himself. Mother and son embraced, weeping bitterly, and recounted everything that had happened. After settling the bill at the inn, they set off for the capital. Upon entering the prime minister's residence, Guangrui, Miss Yin, his mother, and Xuanzang all met the lady of the house. Overjoyed, she ordered her servants to prepare a grand feast in celebration.\\n\\nThe prime minister declared, \\\"Let us call today's banquet the Reunion Feast.\\\" It truly was a joyful family gathering.\\n\\nThe next morning, Emperor Tang ascended the throne, and Prime Minister Yin stepped forward to report in detail all that had transpired, recommending Guangrui for high office. The emperor approved the recommendation and immediately appointed Chen E as a scholar, entrusting him with state affairs. Xuanzang resolved to devote himself to Zen meditation and was sent to practice at Hongfu Temple. Later, Miss Yin calmly took her own life, and Xuanzang returned to Jinshan Temple to express gratitude to Abbot Faming. As for what happened afterward, we shall leave that for the next installment.\\n\\nTable of Contents, Chapter Nine: Yuan Shoucheng's Brilliant Calculation, Free from Selfish Intentions; the Old Dragon King's Foolish Scheme Violates Heavenly Law\\n\\nPoem:\\n\\nA great city in the capital, truly worth beholding,\\nEight rivers flow around the four mountains.\\nHow many emperors rose from this place;\\nSince ancient times, the world speaks of Chang'an.\\n\\nThis chapter specifically describes the great city of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, the site where emperors of successive dynasties established their capitals. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, the land has been adorned with colorful flowers, and eight rivers flow around the city. Thirty-six flower-lined alleys and seventy-two music pavilions stand proudly.According to the map of Hua and Yi, the world’s foremost region truly is a land of extraordinary beauty. Now, Emperor Taizong Wen of the Tang Dynasty has ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Longji Zhenguan. It has already been thirteen years since his coronation, and the current year is Ji Si. Not to mention the heroic figures who stand before him, safeguarding the realm and stabilizing the country, nor those outstanding talents who fought bravely to expand its borders.\\n\\nNow, let us speak of two virtuous men living by the Jing River outside Chang’an city: one is a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other a woodcutter named Li Ding. Both are scholars who failed the imperial examinations but are literate mountain folk. One day, after selling their firewood in Chang’an and trading the carp from their baskets, they entered an inn together, enjoyed themselves until half-drunk, each carrying a bottle, and slowly strolled back along the banks of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:\\n\\n“Brother Li, I think those who strive for fame end up sacrificing their bodies for it; those who chase profit lose themselves in pursuit of gain; those who accept titles sleep with tigers by their side; and those who bask in favor carry snakes up their sleeves. When you come down to it, we’re better off enjoying our serene waters and verdant mountains, living freely and carefree, content with simplicity, letting fate guide us.”\\n\\nLi Ding replied, “Brother Zhang, you make a valid point. But your beautiful waters aren’t as good as my lush mountains.”\\n\\nZhang Shao retorted, “Your lush mountains aren’t as fine as my beautiful waters.”\\n\\nTo prove his point, he quoted a poem titled “Die Lian Hua”:\\n\\n“On misty waters stretching ten thousand li, a tiny boat drifts alone, quietly moored beneath a lone awning, the voice of Xi Shi lingers round about. Free from worldly cares, cleansed of greed and fame, I leisurely pluck reeds and smartweeds by the willow-lined shore. A few sand terns delight my eyes, in willow groves and reed bays, my wife and children laugh with joy. After a peaceful sleep, the winds and waves seem playful—no honor, no disgrace, no worries at all.”\\n\\nLi Ding countered, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Die Lian Hua’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“In a stretch of cloud-covered woods, pines bloom profusely; silently I listen to the warbling birds, their tongues as skillful as flutes. The red fades, the green grows rich—the spring is warm, yet summer swiftly arrives. Then autumn comes easily, changing everything; golden flowers bloom, perfect for admiring. And soon winter arrives sharp as a finger snap, yet I roam free through all four seasons, unbothered by anyone.”\\n\\nThe fisherman said, “Your lush mountains can’t compare to my beautiful waters. Let me share a ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to illustrate how much better off we are:\\n\\n“In the fairyland of clouds and water, life is complete; a boat with oars laid across is my home. Fresh scales I slice, green turtles I cook; purple crabs steamed, red shrimp boiled. Green bamboo shoots, water plantain sprouts—water caltrops and lotus roots are even more delightful. Tender lotus roots, aged lotus seeds, tender celery leaves—water chestnuts, water bamboo, and bird’s-eye flowers.”\\n\\nThe woodcutter replied, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to show how much better we have it:\\n\\n“Towering peaks reach toward the horizon, a thatched hut is my home. Cured chicken, goose, crab, and turtle—wild boar, roe deer, hare, and deer surpass fish and shrimp. Chinese toon leaves, yellow catalpa buds—bamboo shoots and mountain tea are even more splendid. Purple plums, red peaches, ripe apricots and plums, sweet pears, sour jujubes, osmanthus blossoms.”\\n\\nThe fisherman insisted, “Your lush mountains really can’t compete with my beautiful waters. Here’s another ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“A little boat drifts wherever it may, amid countless layers of misty waves, fearless and free. Casting hooks and nets, I catch fresh fish, not greasy or oily, yet delicious beyond compare; old wife and young child gather round for reunion. With plenty of fish, I head to Chang’an market, trade for fine wine, and drink myself into a stupor. My raincoat serves as blanket on the autumn river, snoring peacefully, without a care, unattached to worldly honors or riches.”\\n\\nThe woodcutter retorted, “Brother Zhang, your beautiful waters still can’t match the joy of my mountain life. Here’s a ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“A few thatched huts built beneath the hills, pines, bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids—how lovely they are! Through forests and over ridges, I search for dry firewood, no one scolds me, I sell as I please, more or less depending on the world. With the money earned, I buy wine and drink at will, savoring freedom in earthenware bowls and porcelain cups. Drunken and drowsy, I lie beneath the pines, unburdened, unconcerned, indifferent to rise or fall in this mortal world.”\\n\\nThe fisherman concluded, “Brother Li, your mountain life can’t match the joy of my riverside business. Here’s a ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“The red smartweed blooms profusely under moonlight, yellow reeds sway wildly in the breeze. The azure sky stretches far, the Chu River flows empty and clear, stirring the reflections of stars in the pond. Big fish swim in schools into the net, small mandarin fish cluster around the hook. Once caught, they taste especially rich when cooked—laughing and joking, I roam the rivers and lakes.”\\n\\nThe woodcutter responded, “Brother Zhang, your riverside life still can’t match the joy of my mountain business. Here’s another ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\n\\n“Withered leaves and dead vines fill the paths, broken branches and old bamboo cover the hills. Wild vines and dried kudzu twine wildly, I gather them, tie them up, and carry them off. Worm-eaten hollow elm and willow, wind-broken pine and nanmu trees—\\nI collect them, pile them up for winter’s cold, and trade them for wine and money.”The fisherman said, \\\"Though your mountain may be comparable, it still can't match the serene elegance of my waters. Here's a poem to prove it: As the tide ebbs, a lone boat drifts away; at night's deep hour, the oarsman's song fades off. Under the crescent moon, my raincoat brings such quiet charm—wakeful gulls startled, yet unable to rise; colorful clouds part in the sky. Lying idly on the reed isle, with nothing to do, I linger until the sun climbs three poles high. Following my heart's desire, I arrange my days as I please; while courtiers shiver waiting for the watchman's call, how could they compare to my carefree spirit?\\\" The woodcutter replied, \\\"Your waters' tranquil grace cannot rival the deeper serenity of my green mountains, and here's another poem to attest: On autumn paths, I stride forth with axe in hand; in evening coolness, I return bearing my load. Wildflowers tucked into my hair bring even greater wonder—parting clouds, I find my way; waiting for the moon, I knock at the gate. My young son and mountain wife greet me with joyful smiles; on a bed of grass and wooden pillow, I stretch and rest. Steaming pears and cooking millet, I quickly prepare; new brew matures in jars—truly, this deepens my tranquil heart!\\\" The fisherman continued, \\\"These are merely our trades, our means of sustenance. You lack the joys I find in leisure time, as this poem shows: Leisurely watching white cranes fly across the sky, I moor my boat by the stream and close the green door. Leaning against the cabin, I teach my child to twist fishing lines, and after rowing, spread the nets out with my wife. With calm resolve, I truly sense the waves have stilled; at ease, I naturally feel the breeze grow mild. A green raincoat and bamboo hat I wear at will—far better than donning purple robes in court.\\\" The woodcutter responded, \\\"Yet your leisure time still doesn't match mine, as this poem also proves: Leisurely watching wispy clouds drift by, I sit alone in my thatched hut, closing the bamboo door. Without tasks, I instruct my child to read from scrolls; sometimes, I gather friends to play chess. When joy comes, I lean on my staff and sing along fragrant paths; when inspiration strikes, I carry my zither up to verdant heights. Straw sandals, hemp ropes, coarse cloth for bedding—such contentment far surpasses fine silken robes.\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\"Li Ding, we truly can enjoy light verses together without needing drums or golden goblets. Let's exchange a few lines each, and see how well we fishermen and woodcutters converse.\\\" Li Ding replied, \\\"Brother Zhang speaks most wisely; please begin with a verse.\\\" \\\"My boat rests in emerald waters amid misty ripples, my home lies deep in mountains and wild fields. I especially love spring floods over stream bridges, and most cherish morning mists among rocky peaks. Fresh carp from Longmen often graced my pot, dry firewood charred under daily flames. Fishing nets provide various ways to support old age, carrying poles sustain me till the end. In my small boat, I lie back watching geese take flight, along grassy paths slanting, listening to cranes cry out. In the marketplace of words, I hold no stake; in seas of right and wrong, my trace grows faint. By the stream, cloths hang drying like brocade, on stones I sharpen axes sharp as blades. Under autumn moons, I often fish alone; in spring mountains, no one meets me in solitude. When fish abound, I trade them for wine to share with my wife; leftover firewood sells to buy more liquor for my children. Singing and sipping freely, I let loose and roam; long songs and sighs, I yield to winds that toss and turn. Calling brothers and shipmates, I invite fellow travelers; friends and companions gather with rustic folk. Drinking games and fist-clenching contests pass cups repeatedly; card games and wordplay fill the hours with laughter. Cooking shrimp and crabs brings daily delight, stir-frying duck and braising chicken makes every day rich. My simple wife brews tea with playful ease, my mountain wife cooks meals with calm assurance. At dawn, I raise my staff to stir gentle waves, at sunrise, I carry firewood over rushing streams. After rain, I don my raincoat to catch live carp; in wind, I wield my axe to fell dead pines. Hiding from the world, I feign foolishness and dullness, concealing my name and living mute and deaf.\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\"Brother Li, I took the liberty of starting first; now it's your turn—please begin a couplet, and I shall follow.\\\" \\\"A madman of mountains and wilds, pretending madness in wind and moonlight, an old man lingering proudly in rivers and lakes. Free time belongs to those who live carefree lives, free from gossip, rejoicing in peace. On moonlit nights, I sleep soundly in a thatched hut; in dusk, a light bamboo cloak shields my body. Lost in joy, I make friends with pine and plum, gladly pledge with gulls and egrets. No schemes for fame and fortune occupy my mind; no sounds of strife reach my ears. A sip of fragrant homemade wine at any hour, three meals of wild vegetable soup each day. Two bundles of firewood sustain my life, a fishing rod provides my livelihood. I casually call my child to sharpen steel axes, quietly summon my simple lad to mend old cloths. In spring, I love watching willows turn green, when seasons blend, I delight in reeds and rushes. In summer, I escape the heat by tending new bamboo shoots, in June, I cool off picking tender water caltrops. When frost descends, chickens grow plump and ready for slaughter, on Double Ninth Festival, crabs thrive and are cooked just in time. In winter, I still sleep late as the sun rises, through the Nine Cold Days, I stay warm without steaming. Through all eight seasons, I let my nature run free in the mountains; in four seasons, I indulge my heart by the lake. Gathering firewood brings the joy of immortals, fishing bears no mark of worldly ties. Outside my door, wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues; before my boat, green waters ripple smoothly. Content in my humble state, I need not speak of high office; my settled nature surpasses even a city ten miles wide.\\\"“Ten miles of city walls, high defenses and strict orders; three high officials, their status renowned, listening to imperial edicts. To enjoy mountains and waters is truly rare—how grateful we are to Heaven, Earth, and the gods!” As they exchanged verses and linked their poetic lines, they reached the point where their paths diverged and bowed farewell to each other. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, take care on your journey! Be cautious when climbing the mountain, watch out for tigers. If any danger should arise, tomorrow’s street might see one less old friend!” Upon hearing this, Li Ding flew into a rage: “You lazy scoundrel! True friends share life and death together—how dare you curse me like that? If I meet with harm from a tiger, you’ll surely face the waves and be swept away by the river!” Zhang Shao replied, “I swear I’ll never be tossed about by rivers again.” Li Ding retorted, “Heaven holds unpredictable storms, and fate brings temporary fortune or misfortune. How can you guarantee you’ll remain unscathed?” Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, though you speak thus, you haven’t grasped the truth; my business, at least, offers some certainty—I’m certain I won’t encounter such trouble.” Li Ding asked, “Your livelihood on the water is extremely dangerous and perilous, shrouded in mystery and obscurity—what certainty can there be?” Zhang Shao replied, “You simply don’t understand. In Chang’an city, on West Gate Street, there’s a fortune-teller who sells divination. Every day I bring him a golden carp, and he secretly passes me a lesson, guiding me by direction, always hitting the mark. Today I went to buy another reading, and he instructed me to cast my net east of Jinghe Bay’s bend and set my line along the western bank—surely I’ll return with a boatload of fish and shrimp. Tomorrow I’ll come into the city, sell my catch, buy wine, and meet up with you again.” With these words, the two parted ways.\\n\\nAs they spoke, someone was lurking in the grass. It turned out that a night demon patrolling the waters of the Jing River had overheard the talk about hitting the mark every time. He quickly rushed back to the Crystal Palace and urgently reported to the Dragon King:\\n\\n“Trouble! Trouble!” The Dragon King asked, “What kind of trouble?” The night demon replied, “While patrolling the riverbank, I heard two fishermen chatting. As they parted, their words were quite alarming. One fisherman said there’s a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an city who makes the most accurate predictions. Every day he gives him a carp, and the fortune-teller secretly teaches him how to hit the mark every single time. If his predictions prove true, won’t he end up wiping out all the aquatic creatures? How then can our underwater palace maintain its splendor, and how can we continue leaping through waves and assisting Your Majesty’s power?” The Dragon King was furious and immediately drew his sword, ready to march on Chang’an and destroy this fortune-teller. But just then, dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp ministers and crab officials, shad generals, mandarin fish lieutenants, and carp prime ministers stepped forward and jointly petitioned:\\n\\n“Your Majesty, please calm down. As the saying goes, words heard casually should not be taken at face value. If Your Majesty goes now, clouds will surely gather, rain will surely fall, and the people of Chang’an may be frightened, drawing blame from Heaven. Your Majesty’s presence is mysterious and unpredictable, capable of infinite transformations—but why not simply transform into a scholar and visit Chang’an yourself? If such a person exists, we can deal with him later; but if he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be unjust to harm others unnecessarily?” The Dragon King heeded their advice, laid down his sword, refrained from summoning clouds or rain, stepped ashore, and transformed himself into a scholar dressed in white, truly majestic and imposing, towering above the valleys and reaching toward the sky. His gait was dignified and proper, his conduct precise and upright. His speech followed Confucius and Mencius, his manners reflected the elegance of King Wen of Zhou. He wore a jade-colored robe and a leisurely headscarf with a single character embroidered on it. Setting off, he strode through the clouds and arrived directly on West Gate Street in Chang’an. There he saw a crowd gathered, bustling and noisy, filled with lively discussions: “Those born in the Year of the Dragon clash with those born in the Year of the Tiger. Though the combinations of Yin-Chen-Si-Hai are considered harmonious, what’s feared is the day clashing with the ruler of the year.” Hearing this, the Dragon King realized this must be the fortune-teller’s place. He stepped forward, pushed through the crowd, and peered inside. What he saw was a room adorned with pearls and jewels on all four walls, rich brocade and silk filling the hall.\\n\\nThe fragrance of precious incense never ceased, and the porcelain bottles held crystal-clear water. On either side hung paintings by Wang Wei, while above the seat hung an image of Guiguzi.\\n\\nA Duanxi inkstone, golden smoke ink, matched perfectly with a brush of frosty bristles; the Fire Pearl Forest and Guo Pu’s numerology stood beside the newly revised court texts. Six Lines mastered thoroughly, Eight Trigrams understood perfectly. Able to know heaven and earth, skilled at discerning spirits and gods. A compass arranged noon and midnight precisely, a belly full of stars clearly arrayed. Indeed, future events and past matters were as clear as moonlit mirrors; which families prospered and which declined, judged as clearly as divine insight. Foreseeing misfortune and determining good fortune, pronouncing death and proclaiming life. Speaking swiftly as wind and rain, writing so that ghosts and gods trembled. The sign read: “Divine Lessons, Master Yuan Shoucheng.” Who was this man? He turned out to be none other than Yuan Shoucheng, uncle of Yuan Tiangang, the current Imperial Astronomer and Chief of the Bureau of Astronomy.Indeed, the gentleman had an extraordinary appearance, graceful demeanor, and his fame spread throughout the land; his skills were unrivaled in Chang'an. The Dragon King entered and met with the gentleman. After exchanging formal greetings, he invited the Dragon to take a seat, and a young attendant presented tea. The gentleman then asked, \\\"What brings you here today?\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\"I've come to consult you about the weather forecast for tomorrow.\\\" The gentleman immediately drew a divination chart from his sleeve and declared, \\\"Clouds obscure the mountaintops, mist veils the treetops. If you're asking about rain, it will surely fall tomorrow.\\\" The Dragon King pressed further, \\\"At what exact time will it rain tomorrow? And how much rainfall can we expect?\\\" The gentleman answered, \\\"Tomorrow at Chen hour clouds will gather, at Si hour thunder will roll, at Wu hour rain will begin, and by Wei hour the rain will be sufficient, totaling three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points.\\\" The Dragon King laughed and said, \\\"This cannot be taken lightly! If it truly rains tomorrow according to your predicted timing and amount, I'll reward you with fifty taels of gold as a token of gratitude. But if it doesn't rain, or if the timing or amount is even slightly off, let me tell you plainly—I'll smash your facade, tear down your signboard, and drive you out of Chang'an immediately, never again allowed to deceive the people!\\\" The gentleman cheerfully responded, \\\"Very well, I accept your challenge. Please rest assured, the rain will certainly arrive tomorrow as predicted.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dragon King took his leave, departed Chang'an, and returned to the Water Palace. The lesser water deities greeted him and asked, \\\"How was your visit to that fortune-teller?\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\"Oh yes, indeed! What a smooth-talking fellow! I asked him when it would rain, and he confidently predicted tomorrow's rain. When I pressed him for specific times and amounts, he said clouds would form at Chen hour, thunder would strike at Si hour, rain would start at Wu hour, and by Wei hour the rainfall would reach three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points. So I made a wager with him: if his prediction comes true, I'll give him fifty taels of gold as a reward; but if there's even the slightest discrepancy, I'll destroy his facade, kick him out, and forbid him from ever deceiving people in Chang'an again!\\\" The aquatic creatures all laughed and said, \\\"Your Majesty is the Grand Master of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God in charge of rain—only you know whether it will rain or not. How dare he speak such nonsense? That fortune-teller is sure to lose! He's bound to lose!\\\"\\n\\nJust as the dragon princes, grandsons, and fish, carp, and crabs were still laughing and discussing this matter, they suddenly heard a voice echoing from mid-air: \\\"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial decree!\\\" Everyone looked up and saw a golden-clad warrior holding an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, heading straight toward the Water Palace. Startled, the Dragon King quickly straightened his robes, lit incense, and respectfully received the decree.\\n\\nAfter the golden-clad warrior returned to the heavens, the Dragon King expressed his gratitude, opened the sealed document, and read aloud: \\\"Imperial Edict to the General of the Eight Rivers, commanding thunder and lightning; tomorrow you shall bestow rain to benefit the city of Chang'an.\\\" The edict precisely matched the timing and rainfall amounts predicted by the gentleman, leaving the Dragon King utterly shaken and terrified. After regaining his composure, he addressed the aquatic beings: \\\"There truly are such spiritual individuals in this world! He truly possesses the ability to communicate with heaven and earth—there's no disputing it!\\\"\\n\\nThe strategist Shiji reported, \\\"Your Majesty, rest assured. What difficulty could there be in defeating him? I have a small plan that will silence that fellow once and for all.\\\" The Dragon King asked for details, and the strategist replied, \\\"If we alter the timing of the rain slightly and reduce the amount just a bit, his predictions will clearly be inaccurate. Won't that be enough to prove him wrong? Then we can tear down his signboard, chase him away, and there'll be no trouble at all!\\\" The Dragon King approved the strategy without hesitation.\\n\\nThe next day, he summoned Feng Bo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu, and ascended into the nine heavens above Chang'an. At the appointed time, clouds began to form at Si hour, thunder rumbled at Wu hour, rain fell at Wei hour, and finally ceased at Shen hour—but the total rainfall amounted to only three feet and forty points, one hour earlier than predicted and three inches and eight points less than promised. After issuing orders for his generals to withdraw, he transformed himself back into the guise of a refined scholar dressed in white and headed straight for Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling shop on West Gate Street. Without a word, he smashed the shop's signboard, brush, inkstone, and everything else. Meanwhile, the gentleman calmly sat in his chair, completely unfazed. The Dragon King then picked up a door panel and began striking and shouting, \\\"You deceitful charlatan who spreads false prophecies and misleads the masses! Your divinations are useless, your words absurd! Today's predicted timing and rainfall don't match reality, yet you still sit there boldly. Leave now, or I'll spare your life no longer!\\\" Yet Shoucheng remained utterly fearless, raising his head to the sky and coldly laughing, \\\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've committed no crime, but you, on the other hand, very much have! You may fool others, but you can't fool me. I know exactly who you are—you're not a scholar at all, but the Dragon King of the Jing River. You violated the Jade Emperor's decree by altering the timing and reducing the rainfall, thus breaking heavenly law!\\\"“You’re standing on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, where a fatal blow is inevitable—yet you still dare to scold me here?” Upon hearing this, the Dragon King was seized with fear, his hair standing on end. Hastily dropping the door panel, he straightened his clothes, bowed deeply, and knelt before the master, saying, “Please don’t take offense, Master. Those earlier words were merely spoken in jest; who could have foreseen that falsehood would become reality, and that I’d truly violated heavenly law? What can be done now? I beg you, Master, please save me!\\n\\n“Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t let you go.” Shoucheng replied, “I cannot save you myself, but I can point out a path for you to reincarnate.” The dragon said, “I humbly request your guidance.” The master continued, “Tomorrow at the third hour of noon, you are scheduled to appear before Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official, to be executed. If you truly wish to keep your life, you must quickly go and plead with Emperor Taizong of Tang, who reigns today. Wei Zheng is the chancellor under the Tang emperor; only by gaining his personal favor can you ensure safety.” Hearing this, the Dragon King bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, and departed.\\n\\nUnaware of how time had passed, the sun had already set in the west, and the moon rose high in the sky. One could see: mist condensed, mountains turned purple, crows weary as they returned home; travelers far from home sought refuge in inns. New geese perched on sandbanks by the ferry landing, and the Milky Way appeared. The watchman urged the passing of the night, while in the lonely village, lamplight flickered without flame. Smoke curled gently from hearths in quiet monasteries, and within butterfly dreams, people vanished from sight. The moon shifted, casting flower shadows onto the railing, stars twinkled wildly. The sound of dripping water marked the hours, and before one knew it, the deep night had already reached its midpoint.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King of the Jing River did not return to his underwater palace. Instead, he remained in mid-air, waiting until around midnight, when he gathered his clouds and dispersed his mists, heading straight for the entrance of the imperial palace. At that very moment, Emperor Taizong was dreaming he had stepped outside the palace gates, walking beneath the moonlit flowers. Suddenly, the Dragon King transformed into human form and knelt before him, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save me!”\\n\\nTaizong asked, “Who are you? How can I save you?” The Dragon King replied, “Your Majesty is a true dragon, while I am an ordinary dragon. Because I’ve broken heavenly law, I’m due to be executed by Your Majesty’s virtuous minister, Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. That’s why I’ve come to beg you—I implore Your Majesty to save me!”\\n\\nTaizong said, “If Wei Zheng is to carry out the execution, then I can indeed save you. Go with peace of mind.” Overjoyed, the Dragon King bowed deeply in gratitude and departed.\\n\\nNow, after waking from his dream, Emperor Taizong couldn’t stop thinking about it. By dawn, at the third watch, Taizong convened court, gathering officials from both civil and military ranks. There, one could see:\\n\\nSmoke veiled the Phoenix Pavilion, fragrant incense filled the Dragon Tower. Light shimmered on the vermilion throne, clouds brushed past the emerald canopy. Ruler and ministers harmonized as though they were Yao and Shun, ritual music and decorum approached the grandeur of Han and Zhou. Courtiers held lamps, palace maids fanned themselves, their reflections glowing brightly; peacock screens and Kylin halls sparkled everywhere. All cried out “Long live the Emperor!” and offered blessings for ten thousand years. Three silent whips cracked, and all bowed in ceremonial attire before the imperial crown. Palace flowers bloomed brilliantly, their heavenly fragrance filling the air; willows along the embankment swayed gently, accompanied by imperial music. Pearl curtains and jade drapes hung high, secured by golden hooks; dragon-and-phoenix fans and mountain-and-river banners adorned the royal carriage as it paused. Civil officials stood elegant and refined, military generals proud and alert. The imperial road distinguished high from low, and ranks lined up on the vermilion platform. Golden seals and purple ribbons honored three great elephants, symbolizing enduring prosperity for countless ages.\\n\\nOnce the officials had finished their greetings and dispersed into their respective groups, Emperor Taizong, with eyes like phoenixes and dragon pupils, carefully examined each one from head to toe. Among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui, and others; among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaogin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, Qin Shubao, and many more—all dignified and solemn, yet Wei Zheng, the chancellor, was conspicuously absent. Emperor Taizong summoned Xu Shiji to the throne and said, “Last night, I had a strange dream. I dreamed someone came forward to pay homage, claiming to be the Dragon King of the Jing River, who had broken heavenly law and was due to be executed by Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. He begged me to save him, and I promised to do so. Yet today, Wei Zheng is nowhere to be seen among the officials assembled. Why is that?”\\n\\nShiji replied, “This dream must be taken seriously. Wei Zheng will arrive shortly; Your Majesty must not let him leave the palace. Only by keeping him here for another day can we save the dragon from the dream.”\\n\\nDelighted, Emperor Taizong immediately issued an edict, ordering the imperial messenger to summon Wei Zheng to court.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Wei Zheng was at home, observing the celestial signs at night, burning precious incense, when suddenly he heard the cry of cranes echoing from the nine heavens. It was an envoy sent by Heaven, bearing a golden decree from the Jade Emperor, instructing him to execute the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream at the third hour of noon. Grateful for Heaven’s grace, Wei Zheng had already fasted and bathed, testing his wisdom sword and summoning his spiritual essence within his residence, which is why he hadn’t attended court. When the imperial messenger arrived with the decree, he was overcome with fear and anxiety, yet dared not disobey the emperor’s command. Thus, he hastily dressed and belted himself, taking the decree with him as he hurried to court, where he prostrated himself before the emperor and confessed his guilt.Emperor Tang issued an edict, saying, \\\"I hereby pardon you and declare you innocent.\\\" At that time, the ministers had not yet adjourned the court session. However, upon hearing these words, the emperor ordered the curtains to be drawn back and dismissed the assembly, leaving only Wei Zheng behind. He was summoned to the Golden Hall and then invited into the private audience chamber, where they first discussed strategies for ensuring peace within the realm and plans for stabilizing the country. As it neared the end of the fourth hour and the beginning of the fifth, the emperor instructed a palace attendant to bring out a large chessboard, saying, \\\"Let us play a game, my wise minister.\\\" The imperial consorts promptly brought forth the chessboard and set it up on the royal desk. Wei Zheng gratefully accepted the honor and immediately began playing chess with Emperor Tang.\\n\\nAs for the outcome of the game, we shall leave that for the next installment to reveal."},"usage":{"description":"token用量","type":"object","properties":{"inputTokens":{"description":"输入token数","type":"integer","format":"int64","example":"1004"},"outputTokens":{"description":"输出token数","type":"integer","format":"int64","example":"1261"},"totalTokens":{"description":"总token数","type":"integer","format":"int64","example":"2265"}}}}}}}}},"errorCodes":{"400":[{"errorCode":"IdempotentParameterMismatch","errorMessage":"The request uses the same client token as a previous, but non-identical request.

Grinding bricks into mirrors, piling up snow for sustenance—how many youthful years have we thus lost in delusion? Swallowing the vast ocean with a hair, fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed—why do we still wear golden crowns and forced smiles? When enlightenment dawns, we transcend the ten stages and three vehicles; yet if we linger, we remain trapped within the four realms of existence and six paths. Who has heard, beneath the shadowless tree before the cliff of utter emptiness, the cuckoo’s cry heralding spring’s dawn? The Caosi trail is perilous, and the clouds over Jiling run deep; here, old friends’ voices fade away. On cliffs of thousand-zhang ice, five-petaled lotuses bloom, and incense curls from the ancient temple’s hanging curtains. At that moment, when we discern the source and stream, we shall behold the Dragon King’s Three Treasures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis poem is titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Su Wu Slow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It tells of our Buddha, Shakyamuni, bidding farewell to the Jade Emperor and returning to the sacred abode of Leiyin. There, he found three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great vajras, and countless bodhisattvas, each holding banners, canopies, wondrous treasures, and celestial flowers, arrayed in the spiritual realm of Spirit Mountain beneath the twin banyan trees to greet him. Ascending upon auspicious clouds, Shakyamuni addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"With profound wisdom, I have manifested throughout the three realms. The fundamental nature is ultimately tranquil and extinguished, identical to the void, devoid of all things. To subdue the rebellious monkey was no easy task; few could comprehend it. Birth and death begin with names, and phenomena are as they appear.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Having spoken, he emitted rays of sarira light, filling the sky with forty-two radiant white rainbows stretching north and south. Upon seeing this, the crowd prostrated themselves in reverence. Soon after, auspicious clouds gathered, forming a lotus throne of supreme quality, upon which he sat serenely. The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight vajras, and four bodhisattvas approached, palms joined in prayer, and asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who was it that stirred up chaos in Heaven and disturbed the peach banquet?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Shakyamuni replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That fellow is a demonic monkey born on Flower Fruit Mountain, whose crimes are immeasurable and beyond description. Even the heavenly generals could not subdue him, though Erlang captured him. Even Laozi's fiery refining could not harm him. When I arrived, he was amidst the thunder gods, flaunting his might and spirit. I stopped the fighting, questioned him about his origins. He claimed supernatural powers, the ability to transform, and to ride the somersault cloud, covering one hundred and eight thousand li in a single leap. We made a wager: if he couldn't escape my grasp, I would seize him and imprison him under Five Elements Mountain. The Five Emperors opened their golden palaces and jade chambers, inviting me to take the chief seat and holding a grand assembly to honor me, after which I departed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe crowd rejoiced upon hearing this, praising him profusely. After expressing gratitude, they dispersed into their respective groups, each resuming their duties and enjoying pure bliss. Indeed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAuspicious mists fill the land of India, rainbow light surrounds the honored one. In the West, he is called first—the formless Dharma King! Often we see mystical monkeys offering fruit, deer carrying flowers; green phoenixes dance, colorful phoenixes sing; sacred turtles present longevity, cranes capture medicinal herbs. Enjoying the Pure Land of Jetavana, partaking in the dragon palace's realm of Dharma. Flowers bloom daily, fruits ripen at every hour, cultivating tranquility and returning to truth, practicing Zen with genuine results. Neither annihilation nor birth, neither increase nor decrease. Mist and rosy clouds drift freely back and forth, unaffected by cold or heat, time itself forgotten.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the poem says:\\\\\\\\nFree to come and go, carefree and at ease, free from fear and sorrow. In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, all is open and clear; in the great thousandfold world, there is neither spring nor autumn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, while residing between the sacred mountain of Leiyin and the moonlit Spirit Mountain, the Buddha summoned all the Buddhas, Arhats, protectors, bodhisattvas, vajras, monks, nuns, and others, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since subduing the rebellious monkey and pacifying Heaven, I have remained unaware of the passage of time, yet I estimate half a millennium has passed in the mortal realm, and now it is the full-moon day of early autumn. I possess a precious basin filled with a hundred varieties of flowers and a thousand kinds of exotic fruits, among other treasures. How shall we celebrate this 'Ullambana Festival' together with the Dharma?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Each member of the assembly joined their palms, bowed three times before the Buddha, and understood his intention. Then, Shakyamuni instructed Ananda to carry the basin of flowers and fruits, while Ksitigarbha scattered offerings, filling the crowd with gratitude. Everyone offered poems in thanks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of blessings says:\\\\\\\\nBlessings shine brightly before the revered one, blessings embrace the depths and extend far and wide. Boundless virtue endures as long as the earth, blessed connections link us to heaven. Fields of blessing expand yearly, the sea of fortune grows deeper with each passing year. Blessings fill the universe, abundant shade and endless growth, ever complete and boundless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of prosperity says:\\\\\\\\nProsperity weighs as heavily as mountains, the colorful phoenix sings its song. Prosperity brings timely good fortune, like the evening star shining brightly. Adding ten thousand measures of wealth ensures health and well-being, enjoying a thousand vessels of peace. Salaries rival heaven, eternally secure, names as vast as the sea, ever clearer. Thoughts of prosperity inspire admiration, titles of honor spread glory across myriad nations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The longevity poem says:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The star of longevity presents colorful offerings to the Buddha. From here, the realm of longevity shines with splendor. Plates brimming with fruits of longevity emit auspicious radiance, and freshly picked flowers of longevity adorn the lotus pedestal. The poems of longevity are elegant and full of wonders, while the melodies of longevity harmonize beautifully with talented voices. Longevity extends as long as the sun and moon, and may it be as vast and serene as mountains and seas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\After all the Bodhisattvas finished their offerings, they respectfully requested the Buddha to clearly explain the fundamental principles and trace the origins. The Buddha slightly opened his compassionate mouth, expounded the great Dharma, and proclaimed the true fruit, lecturing on the profound scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the perfection of the Five Skandhas. At that moment, heavenly dragons circled around, and flowers rained down in profusion. Indeed: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Zen mind brightly illuminates the moon over a thousand rivers, and true nature embraces the vastness of ten thousand miles of sky.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After finishing his lecture, the Buddha addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the four great continents I now manifest, sentient beings differ in goodness and evil from place to place. In the Eastern Continent of Jambudvipa, people revere heaven and earth, with clear minds and calm spirits. In the Northern Continent of Uttarakuru, though fond of their own kin, they merely struggle for survival, possessing simple natures and limited aspirations, rarely indulging in excess. In the Western Continent of Aparagodaniya, people neither covet nor kill, nurturing their qi and cultivating inner spirit; though lacking supreme truth, everyone enjoys a long life. But in the Southern Continent of Kalirupa, greed, lust, and delight in misfortune prevail, with much killing and strife—truly a battlefield of tongues and a sea of slander and evil. Now I have the Tripitaka scriptures, which can persuade people to do good.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Upon hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas clasped their hands in reverence and approached the Buddha, asking: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are the three collections of the Tripitaka scriptures?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have one collection of Dharma, discussing heaven; one collection of Vinaya, speaking of earth; and one collection of Sutra, guiding ghosts. Together, these three collections comprise thirty-five volumes, totaling 15,144 scrolls, representing the path to cultivation and the gateway to righteousness. I intend to send them to the Eastern Land, but alas, the beings there are foolish, slandering the true words and failing to understand the essence of my teachings, neglecting the authentic Yoga tradition. How can we find someone powerful enough to journey to the Eastern Land, seek out a sincere believer, guide him through hardships across thousands of mountains and distant waters, bring him to me to obtain the true scriptures, and perpetually spread them in the Eastern Land? This would indeed be a blessing as vast as mountains and a fortune as deep as the sea. Who would be willing to undertake such a journey?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At this point, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva stepped forward to the lotus pedestal, bowed three times before the Buddha, and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your disciple, though unworthy, is willing to go to the Eastern Land and find someone to retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" All present looked up at the Bodhisattva:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Perfect in virtue and wisdom, his golden body is filled with intelligence. Beaded garlands hang gracefully, fragrant rings gleam with precious light, dark clouds cleverly form coiled dragons, and embroidered ribbons gently flutter like colorful phoenix feathers. A jade clasp adorns his plain silk robe, surrounded by auspicious radiance; a brocade skirt and golden cords bring forth auspicious energy. His brows resemble crescent moons, his eyes like twin stars. Five faces naturally express joy, and his vermilion lips are touched with a hint of red. The vase of pure nectar overflows year after year, and the willow branch inserted askew remains ever green. He resolves eight difficulties and saves countless beings with great compassion; thus he dwells atop great mountains, resides in the South Sea, rescues those in suffering by responding to their cries, universally praised and answered, revered by thousands of saints and spirits. His heart delights in purple bamboo, and his nature cherishes fragrant vines. He is the compassionate lord of Mount Luojia, the living Avalokiteshvara in the Cave of Tidal Sounds.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Seeing this, the Buddha was overjoyed and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No one else can go; only the venerable Avalokiteshvara, with his vast supernatural powers, is capable of undertaking this mission.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If I go to the Eastern Land, do you have any instructions for me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On this journey, you must carefully examine the roads, not traveling through the heavens, but rather among clouds and mists. As you pass mountains and rivers, remember the distances and details of the route, and give careful guidance to the scripture seeker. Fearing that the sincere believer may find the journey difficult, I shall provide you with five treasures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Then he ordered Ananda and Kashyapa to bring forth a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"brocade kasaya robe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nine-ringed staff,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" handing them to the Bodhisattva and saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This robe and staff can be personally used by the scripture seeker. If he comes here with firm resolve, wearing my robe will prevent him from falling into reincarnation, and holding my staff will protect him from harm.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The Bodhisattva received these items with reverence, and the Buddha then took three headbands and handed them to the Bodhisattva, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These treasures are called 'tightening bands.' Though there are three identical ones, each is used differently. I have three incantations of 'Golden Tightening Seal.' If on the road you encounter powerful demons, you must persuade them to reform and become disciples of the scripture seeker. If they refuse to obey, you may place this band on their head, and it will naturally take root in their flesh. By reciting the appropriate incantation, their eyes will swell, their head will ache, and their foreheads will split open, forcing them to enter my fold.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing these words, the Bodhisattva joyfully bowed and stepped back, immediately summoning Huai'an the Pilgrim to accompany him. Huai'an wielded a solid iron staff weighing a thousand jin, serving as a mighty demon-slaying warrior at the Bodhisattva's side. The Bodhisattva then wrapped the Mirror Lake Robe into a bundle and instructed Huai'an to carry it on his back. Concealing the golden ring, the Bodhisattva took up his copper clapper and set off directly down from Spirit Mountain. This journey would bring about a significant outcome: the Buddha's disciple would return to fulfill his original vow, and Elder Golden Cicada would wrap himself in sandalwood robes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain, he was greeted by the Great Immortal of the Golden Summit at Yuzhen Temple, who stood at the temple gate to offer tea. The Bodhisattva dared not linger long and said to the Great Immortal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have received the Buddha's command to travel eastward to seek out the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Great Immortal asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"When will this pilgrim arrive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is uncertain—perhaps within two or three years, or possibly sooner.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" With that, he bade farewell to the Great Immortal, traveling through clouds and mist, carefully noting the route along the way. A poem bears witness to this journey:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Seeking across ten thousand miles without a word,\\\\\\\\nWho can claim complete success when desire remains unfulfilled?\\\\\\\\nTo seek others seems so effortless—\\\\\\\\nIs this not fate, destined for me all my life?\\\\\\\\nThe Way is taught with methods, yet without faith, even truth becomes empty rumor.\\\\\\\\nI pledge my heart and soul to find companionship;\\\\\\\\nI know surely ahead lies an encounter meant by destiny.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs master and disciple continued their journey, they suddenly came upon the Weak Water River, a vast expanse marking the boundary of the Quicksand River. The Bodhisattva remarked:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My disciple, this place proves truly difficult to traverse. How could a mortal with impure flesh and blood possibly cross over?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Huai'an asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Master, how far does this river stretch?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As the Bodhisattva paused to gaze, he saw:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To the east it connects with sandy deserts, reaching both eastern and western lands; to the south it extends to Ugo, and to the north it leads to the Tartars. Eight hundred li lie along its length, while its breadth stretches for countless miles. The water flows like the earth turning over, and the waves surge like mountains rising on their backs. Vast and boundless, desolate and endless, its roar echoes for ten li, and its floodwaters rise ten thousand feet high. Even celestial rafts cannot reach here, nor can lotus leaves float upon its surface. Withered grasses bend beneath the slanting sun, yellow clouds obscure the long embankments. Who among merchants dares to travel here? Where do fishermen find shelter? On the flat sands no geese alight, and from distant shores come the cries of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know the beauty of this scene, and the delicate fragrance of white duckweed lingers faintly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the Bodhisattva surveyed the area, a loud splash erupted from the river, and a hideous demon leaped forth from the waters. Its appearance was truly monstrous:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIts skin neither green nor black, but dull and gloomy; its body neither tall nor short, barefoot and sinewy. Its eyes gleamed like twin lamps at the hearth, its mouth forked like a butcher's cleaver. Fangs protruded like blades, and fiery hair stood disheveled. It roared like thunder, and its feet moved swiftly as if driven by a rolling wind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster brandished a magical staff and rushed ashore, attempting to seize the Bodhisattva. But Huai'an blocked him with his solid iron club, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Halt!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster raised his staff in response, and the two clashed by the Quicksand River. This fierce battle was truly astonishing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMu Zha's iron club protected the righteous path, displaying divine power; the monster's demon-slaying staff fought valiantly. Two silver serpents danced along the riverbank, and two divine beings charged toward the shore. One wielded might over the Quicksand, demonstrating extraordinary skill; the other defended Guanyin, earning great merit. One leapt and splashed through the waves, while the other spewed mist and clouds. Waves and surges darkened the heavens, mist and clouds dimmed the sun and moon. That demon-slaying staff resembled a white tiger emerging from the mountains; this solid iron club was like a yellow dragon lying in wait. One advanced, parting snakes and stirring grass; the other swung wide, scattering hawks and splitting pines. The battle raged until darkness enveloped everything, stars shone brightly, and mist swirled, blurring heaven and earth. That one had long dwelled in the Weak Water, fierce and relentless; this one achieved his first great feat since leaving Spirit Mountain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two fought back and forth for dozens of rounds, evenly matched, with no clear victor. Finally, the monster blocked Mu Zha's iron club and demanded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, to dare confront me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am Mu Zha, the Second Prince of the Heavenly King Tota, known as Huai'an the Pilgrim. I now accompany my master on a journey to the Eastern Lands to seek the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures. Who are you, demon, to boldly block our path?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster suddenly realized, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I remember you practicing alongside Guanyin of the South Sea in the Bamboo Grove! Why have you come here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that Master standing on the shore?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHearing this, the monster stammered repeatedly, lowered his magical staff, and allowed Mu Zha to lead him before Guanyin. Prostrating himself, he pleaded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and listen to my confession. I am no evil spirit—I am the Scroll-Raising General, an attendant to the imperial carriage in the Celestial Palace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I accidentally broke a glass cup during the cricket peach banquet that the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes and banished me to the mortal realm, transforming me into this wretched form. Moreover, every seven days, he commands flying swords to pierce my chest and sides more than a hundred times before withdrawing. Thus, I suffer such torment. With no other choice, driven by unbearable hunger and cold, every two or three days I venture out into the waves to seek passersby for sustenance. Little did I expect today, through ignorance, to have offended the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You were guilty in Heaven, and now that you've been cast down, you continue to harm living beings—truly, sin upon sin. I have received Buddha's decree to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. Why don't you join my path, embrace virtuous fruit, become a disciple of that pilgrim, and accompany him westward to pay homage to the Buddha and obtain the sacred texts? Then I shall ensure the flying swords no longer pierce you. Once your mission is accomplished, you'll be absolved of guilt and restored to your original position. What say you?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am willing to embrace the righteous path.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Stepping forward, he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless humans here, and several pilgrims have passed by, all of whom I've consumed. Every time I ate someone, I tossed their head into the quicksand, where it sank straight to the bottom (a water so deep even goose feathers cannot float). Yet nine pilgrims' skulls floated on the surface, refusing to sink. Thinking them strange objects, I strung them together with a rope and kept them for amusement during idle moments. But now, if the pilgrims never reach this place, wouldn't that only hinder my own future prospects?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How could they possibly fail to arrive? You may hang those skulls above your head as a reminder, waiting patiently for the pilgrims; they will surely prove useful.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If that's the case, I gladly accept your guidance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred the precepts upon him, designated sand as his surname, and thus he became known as Sha Wujing. From that moment, he entered the monastic order, helped the Bodhisattva cross the river, purified his heart and mind, resolved never again to harm living beings, and dedicated himself solely to awaiting the pilgrim.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter bidding farewell to the monster, the Bodhisattva and Muzha set off directly toward the Eastern lands. After traveling for some time, they came upon another towering mountain shrouded in malevolent energy, making it impossible to climb. Just as they prepared to ride the clouds over the mountain, a sudden gust of wind arose, and another demon appeared. This demon was truly fearsome:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHis lips curled upward like lotus petals, his ears resembled giant fans, and his golden eyes gleamed fiercely. His tusks were sharp as steel files, and his gaping mouth seemed like a blazing brazier. A golden helmet tightly secured his cheeks, and armored scales adorned his body like a retreating python. In one hand, he wielded a spiked club resembling a dragon's claw, while a crescent-shaped bow hung from his waist, its ten arrows gleaming brightly. His imposing presence intimidated even the fiercest spirits, and his soaring ambition dwarfed the might of celestial gods. Without hesitation, he charged forward, aiming his spiked club at the Bodhisattva. But Muzha stepped in to block the attack, shouting loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You vile monster, how dare you behave so rudely! Take this!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The demon retorted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This monk doesn't know when to die! Here's my pitchfork!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" And so, beneath the mountain, the two clashed fiercely, battling to decide the victor. It was a truly fierce fight:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe demon was ferocious, yet Hui'an possessed great power. Iron clubs split hearts, and spiked drills met faces head-on. Dust and dirt filled the air, darkening heaven and earth, while flying rocks and debris startled ghosts and gods. The nine-pronged pitchfork gleamed brilliantly, its double rings ringing clearly; the iron staff was sleek and black, soaring through both hands. One was the prince of the Heavenly King, the other a valiant general spirit. One protected the law on Mount Putuo, the other dwelled as a demon in a cave. In this encounter, neither knew who would lose nor who would win.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the two were locked in battle, Guanyin appeared in mid-air, tossing down a lotus flower to separate the pitchfork and staff. Startled, the monster asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, daring to play tricks like 'flowers before my eyes' to deceive me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You mere mortal with fleshly eyes! I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. This lotus flower was thrown by my master—you can't even recognize it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Bodhisattva of the South Sea—is that Guanyin, who sweeps away three calamities and rescues from eight tribulations?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who else could it be?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster dropped his spiked club, bowed deeply, and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother, where is the Bodhisattva? Please trouble yourself to introduce me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuzha pointed upward and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't it right there?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster bowed repeatedly toward the sky, crying out loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive me! Forgive me!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGuanyin descended from the clouds and approached, asking, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What kind of wild boar transformed into a spirit are you, what sort of old pig wreaks havoc here, daring to block my way?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am neither a wild boar nor an old pig—I was originally Tianpeng, the Marshal of the Heavenly River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I teased Chang'e while drunk that the Jade Emperor struck me with two thousand hammer blows and banished me to the mortal realm. My true spirit, in a misguided attempt at rebirth, mistakenly entered the womb of a sow, resulting in this monstrous form. I bit and killed the sow, slaughtered the entire herd of pigs, and seized this mountain territory, surviving by preying on humans. Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered you, Bodhisattva—please, I beg you, save me! Tassa asked, “What is the name of this mountain?” The monster replied, “It’s called Mount Fuleng. Within the mountain lies a cave known as Yunzhan Cave. Originally, there lived a woman named Egg Sister Two inside that cave. Seeing that I had some martial skills, she made me the head of the household and even nicknamed me ‘Inverted Gate.’ But less than a year later, she died, leaving all her possessions to me. Now, after living here for so long, I have no meaningful occupation.” The Bodhisattva said, “As the ancients taught: ‘If you wish for a future, avoid actions that lead to none.’ You broke the laws of Heaven above, yet still refuse to abandon your violent nature, harming living beings and creating karma. Isn’t that committing two offenses at once?” The monster retorted, “A future? A future! If I followed your advice, I’d be left to starve! As the saying goes: ‘Obeying official law means being beaten to death; obeying Buddhist law means starving to death.’ Go away! Go away! It’s better to catch a traveler and feast on his fatty flesh! Who cares about two sins, three sins, a thousand sins, ten thousand sins!” The Bodhisattva replied, “‘Heaven responds to sincere human wishes.’ If you’re willing to turn to the righteous path, there will surely be a place for you to sustain yourself. The world has five grains; they can all satisfy hunger—why must you survive by eating people?” Upon hearing this, the monster seemed to awaken from a dream and said to the Bodhisattva, “I want to follow the right path, but how can I when ‘to offend Heaven leaves no prayer unanswered’?” The Bodhisattva continued, “I’ve received Buddha’s command to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. You could become his disciple and accompany him on a journey westward, redeeming your sins through merit, and I’ll ensure you escape this calamity.” The monster eagerly agreed, exclaiming, “I’m willing! I’m willing!” The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred upon him the precepts, assigned him the surname Zhu (Pig), gave him the Dharma name Zhu Wuneng, and instructed him to observe vegetarian vows, renouncing the five pungent vegetables and the three forbidden meats, patiently awaiting the arrival of the pilgrim. After parting ways with Mutza, the Bodhisattva and Mutza rose into the clouds, traveling onward, when suddenly they saw a jade dragon crying out in mid-air. Approaching it, the Bodhisattva asked, “Who are you, dragon, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon replied, “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I set fire to the luminous pearl in the palace, my father reported me to Heaven, accusing me of rebellion. The Five Emperors hung me in mid-air and beat me three hundred times, and soon I’ll be executed. Please, Bodhisattva, save me!” Hearing this, Guanyin immediately rushed with Mutza toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. There, the two celestial masters, Qiu and Zhang, greeted them and asked, “Where are you headed?” The Bodhisattva replied, “This humble monk wishes to see the Jade Emperor.” The two masters quickly reported the request, and the Jade Emperor descended from his throne to welcome them. After paying respects, the Bodhisattva said, “I’ve been sent by Buddha to seek the pilgrim in the Eastern Lands. On my way, I encountered a wicked dragon hanging here, and I’ve come specifically to petition for mercy, asking that his life be spared and entrusted to me, so he may serve as a mount for the pilgrim.” Upon hearing this, the Five Emperors immediately issued an edict of pardon, ordering a heavenly general to release the dragon and deliver him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva expressed gratitude and departed. The little dragon prostrated himself, thanking the Bodhisattva for saving his life, and pledged obedience to her commands. The Bodhisattva placed him deep in a ravine, where he would wait for the pilgrim to arrive, transforming into a white horse and earning merit in the West. The little dragon accepted the order and quietly disappeared. Leading Mutza, the Bodhisattva continued her journey across this mountain and onward toward the Eastern Lands. Not long after, they suddenly saw countless golden rays of light and auspicious vapors rising in thousands of streams. Mutza exclaimed, “Master, that shining place must be the Five Elements Mountain, where the Buddha’s ‘seal’ is affixed!” The Bodhisattva confirmed, “Indeed, that’s the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who once disrupted the Peach Banquet and caused chaos in the Heavenly Palace—he now lies imprisoned beneath this seal.” Mutza agreed, “Exactly, exactly!” Master and disciple climbed the mountain together and gazed upon the inscription, which read the six-syllable mantra: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” After examining it, the Bodhisattva sighed deeply and composed a poem, which reads:  \\\\\\\\nHow pitiful that the mischievous monkey defied authority,  \\\\\\\\nOnce reckless and bold, flaunting heroic might.  \\\\\\\\nDeceitful, he disrupted the Peach Banquet,  \\\\\\\\nDaringly intruded upon the Tuishou Palace.  \\\\\\\\nUnrivaled among ten thousand soldiers,  \\\\\\\\nHis might resounded through the nine heavens.  \\\\\\\\nNow trapped by our Buddha Shakyamuni,  \\\\\\\\nWhen will he stretch forth again and display his glory?  \\\\\\\\nWhile master and disciple were speaking, the Great Sage was already alerted.Da Sheng stood at the foot of the mountain and shouted loudly,  \\\\\\\\n“Who is it up there on the hill, reciting poetry and exposing my flaws?”  \\\\\\\\nUpon hearing this, the Bodhisattva immediately descended the mountain to investigate. Below the rocky cliff, they found the local deity, the mountain god, and the celestial generals who had been guarding the Great Sage—all coming forward to greet the Bodhisattva and escort them before the Great Sage himself. When they looked closely, they saw that he was trapped inside a stone casket, able to speak but unable to move. The Bodhisattva asked, “Hey you with the surname Sun, do you recognize me?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage opened his fiery golden eyes, nodded vigorously, and cried out, “How could I not know you? You are indeed the compassionate and merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo in the South Sea, who saves those in distress and hardship. Thank you for your kindness! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been spending each day here like an eternity, with not a single acquaintance to visit me. But pray tell, where have you come from?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “I was sent by the Buddha’s decree to journey eastward in search of someone to retrieve scriptures. Passing by here, I paused briefly to check on you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage said, “The Buddha deceived me, trapping me beneath this mountain for over five hundred years, unable to break free. I earnestly beg you, great Bodhisattva, to show me some mercy and rescue old Sun once and for all!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva responded, “Your sins run deep. If I were to free you now, I fear you’d only cause more trouble—such an outcome would hardly be commendable.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage insisted, “I’ve already repented deeply. Please, great compassionate one, point me toward a path of redemption, and I’ll willingly devote myself to cultivation.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so it came to pass:  \\\\\\\\n“A single thought arises in the human heart, and heaven and earth take note. If good and evil remain unpunished, surely heaven and earth must harbor bias.”  \\\\\\\\nHearing these words, the Bodhisattva felt immense joy and said to the Great Sage, “As the scriptures say: ‘Speak kindly, and distant lands will respond; speak unkindly, and distant lands will recoil.’ Since you’ve shown such sincerity, when I reach the Tang Empire in the East, I’ll find someone tasked with retrieving scriptures and instruct him to rescue you. You can become his disciple, uphold the teachings, and enter the Buddhist fold. Then we can work together toward enlightenment. What do you say?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage exclaimed loudly, “I accept! I accept!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva continued, “Since you’ve shown such virtue, let me give you a Dharma name.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage replied, “I already have a name—I’m called Sun Wukong.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva happily added, “Two others have previously taken refuge under the character ‘Wu’—you too shall bear that character, perfectly aligning with them. How wonderful, how wonderful! There’s no need for further reminders; I shall depart now.”  \\\\\\\\nThus, the Great Sage, having realized his true nature, returned wholeheartedly to Buddhism, while the Bodhisattva lingered, mindful of her divine mission.  \\\\\\\\nTogether with Mutzha, they set off eastward, arriving without delay in Chang’an, the capital of the Tang Empire. As mist cleared and clouds dispersed, master and disciple transformed into two ragged, leprous monks, entering the city of Chang’an unnoticed, unaware that evening had already fallen. Walking along the main market street, they spotted a local deity shrine and stepped right inside, startling the local deity and sending the ghostly soldiers into trembling fear. Realizing it was the Bodhisattva, the deity quickly prostrated himself in reverence. Hastily, the local deity ran to inform the City God, the district magistrate, and all the deities of every temple throughout Chang’an, who promptly gathered to pay their respects, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our tardiness in welcoming you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “You must not reveal this news. I’ve come here specifically by the Buddha’s command to seek out someone who will retrieve scriptures. I’ll temporarily stay in your temple for a few days, until I find the true monk, then I’ll return.”  \\\\\\\\nAll the deities returned to their respective posts, and the local deity was hurriedly relocated to the City God’s temple for temporary residence, while the master and disciple concealed their true forms.  \\\\\\\\nFor now, we don’t yet know whether they’ll succeed in finding the scripture seeker. Tune in next time to find out.  \\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Appendix: Chen Guangrui Sets Off for Office and Encounters Disaster; Jiangliu Monk Takes Revenge to Restore His Roots.  \\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of Chang’an, the great capital of Shaanxi Province, a city built as the imperial seat by emperors of past dynasties. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han eras, the three districts have blossomed like brocade, and eight rivers flow around the city, truly making it a land of scenic wonders. At this time, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Zhenguan, and had already reigned for thirteen years, in the year of Ji Si. The realm enjoyed peace, tribute flowed in from all directions, and the four seas acknowledged his sovereignty. One day, Emperor Taizong convened all civil and military officials, and after the morning ceremony concluded, Prime Minister Wei Zheng stepped forward and reported, “Today the realm is peaceful, and tranquility prevails in all directions. In accordance with ancient custom, we should open examination halls, recruit talented individuals, and promote capable people to serve in governance.”  \\\\\\\\nEmperor Taizong said,  \\\\\\\\n“What you propose, esteemed minister, is entirely reasonable.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so he issued a notice calling for talented scholars, proclaiming throughout the empire: all prefectures, provinces, and counties, regardless of whether they were military or civilian, anyone among the literati who possessed clear understanding of classical texts and excelled in the three examinations, should travel to Chang’an to take the test.When the imperial edict reached the region of Haizhou, a man named Chen Guangrui, with the courtesy name E, saw it and immediately returned home. He said to his mother, Lady Zhang, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The court has issued a yellow proclamation, calling for talented individuals from southern provinces to take the examinations. I intend to go and compete. If I can secure even a minor official post, it will bring honor and fame to my family, ensure prosperity for my wife and children, and bring glory to our household—this is my greatest ambition. I am informing you of my decision before I depart.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My son, as a scholar, you should indeed 'study in youth and act in adulthood.' That is exactly how it should be. But when you go to take the exams, you must be careful along the way, and once you obtain an official position, return home promptly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui then instructed his servants to pack his belongings, bid farewell to his mother, and set off on his journey without delay. Upon arriving in Chang'an, he found that the examination grounds were already open, so he entered the competition. After passing the preliminary tests and successfully completing the three policy essays in the imperial court examination, Emperor Tang personally bestowed upon him the title of zhuangyuan (top scholar) and awarded him a horse to ride through the streets for three days. Unexpectedly, during his parade, he passed by the residence of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, whose only daughter, Wen Jiao, also known as Mantang Jiao, had not yet married. She was standing atop a beautifully decorated pavilion, tossing a silk ball to select her husband. As Chen Guangrui happened to pass below, the young lady caught sight of his outstanding appearance and recognized him as the newly crowned zhuangyuan. Overjoyed, she threw down the silk ball, which landed squarely on Guangrui's black official cap. Suddenly, a gentle melody of flutes and strings filled the air, and more than ten maids descended from the pavilion, leading Guangrui's horse and escorting him into the prime minister's mansion to celebrate their wedding. The prime minister and his wife immediately came out to greet the guests, officiated the ceremony, and formally betrothed the young lady to Guangrui. They bowed to heaven and earth, exchanged vows as husband and wife, and paid respects to the bride's parents. The prime minister then ordered a banquet to be prepared, and they celebrated joyfully throughout the night.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two held hands tenderly as they entered the bridal chamber. The next morning, at the third watch of the day, Emperor Taizong took his seat in the Golden Hall, surrounded by civil and military officials who had gathered for court. Taizong asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What official position should be granted to the newly appointed zhuangyuan, Chen Guangrui?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Prime Minister Wei Zheng replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your servant has examined the available vacancies in various prefectures and counties and found that Jiangzhou currently has an unoccupied post. I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint him to this position.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Taizong immediately agreed and appointed Guangrui as governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to prepare for departure without delay. Guangrui expressed his gratitude, left the palace, returned to the prime minister's residence, discussed the matter with his wife, bid farewell to his in-laws, and set off with his wife toward Jiangzhou to assume his new post.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they left Chang'an, the weather was late spring, with gentle breezes turning the willows green and fine rain sprinkling red blossoms. Upon arriving home, Guangrui and his wife paid their respects to Lady Zhang. Lady Zhang said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Congratulations, my son! You've not only succeeded in the examinations but have also brought your bride home.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is entirely due to your blessings, Mother, that I was fortunate enough to become zhuangyuan, received the imperial procession through the streets, and encountered the silk ball toss in front of Prime Minister Yin's residence, where I was chosen as his daughter's husband. Now the court has appointed me governor of Jiangzhou, and I have come to fetch you so we may all travel together to take up my post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang was overjoyed and began preparing for the journey. After several days on the road, they arrived at Liu Xiao'er's inn near Wanhuadian. Suddenly, Lady Zhang fell ill, and she said to Guangrui, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm feeling unwell. Let's rest here for two days to recover before continuing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui obeyed her wishes. The following morning, he noticed a man selling a golden carp outside the inn. Guangrui bought it for one guan, intending to cook it for his mother. But as he looked closer, he saw that the fish blinked its eyes mysteriously. Astonished, Guangrui exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've heard that fish and snakes blink their eyes—it surely can't be an ordinary creature!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He then asked the fisherman, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Where did you catch this fish?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Fifteen li from the city, in the Hongjiang River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui immediately released the fish back into the river. Returning to the inn, he told his mother about it, and she said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Releasing living creatures is a virtuous deed, and I'm very pleased.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui added, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We've already stayed here for three days, and time is pressing. I plan to leave tomorrow, but I wonder if you're well enough to travel?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not feeling well, and the heat along the road might worsen my condition. Why don't you rent a house here temporarily while I stay behind? Leave some money with me, and you two can go ahead to take up your post. I'll join you when the autumn coolness arrives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui consulted with his wife, rented a house, gave his mother some funds, and bid them both farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe journey was arduous, with days of travel and nights spent in lodging, and soon they reached the Hongjiang ferry crossing. There, they found Liu Hong and Li Biao waiting to guide them across the river. It seemed that Guangrui's past karma had destined him to encounter these ill-fated individuals.Guangrui ordered his servant to carry their luggage aboard the boat. As husband and wife were about to board together, Liu Hong opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin: her face was as bright as the full moon, her eyes like autumn waters, her lips cherry-red, and her waist slender as a willow branch—indeed possessing beauty enough to make fish sink and wild geese fall from the sky, a countenance so dazzling it could shame the moon and blush flowers. Instantly consumed by wolfish intent, he conspired with Li Biao, steering the boat to an uninhabited stretch of water. When midnight struck, they first killed the servant, then beat Guangrui to death, dumping both bodies into the river. Seeing her husband slain, the young lady prepared to throw herself into the water as well. But Liu Hong grabbed her tightly, saying, “If you yield to me, all will be forgiven! If not, I’ll cut you down right here!” With no other choice, the lady reluctantly agreed, submitting to Liu Hong for the time being. The villain then rowed the boat to the southern shore, handing it over to Li Biao to manage, while he himself donned Guangrui’s attire and official credentials, taking the lady with him to assume his post in Jiangzhou.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the body of the murdered servant drifted downstream with the current, but Guangrui’s corpse sank to the bottom and remained motionless. A sea demon patrolling near the mouth of the Hong River happened to notice it and immediately reported to the Dragon King’s palace. At that very moment, the Dragon King was presiding over court when the demon reported: “Today, near the mouth of the Hong River, someone unknown has beaten to death a scholar and left his body at the bottom of the water.” The Dragon King ordered the body to be brought forth and examined closely. Upon inspection, he declared, “This man is none other than my savior! How could he have been murdered? As the saying goes, one repays kindness with kindness. Today, I must save his life to repay the favor he once showed me.” He immediately penned an official decree and dispatched the demon straight to the City God and Land Deity of Hongzhou, instructing them to retrieve the scholar’s soul and restore his life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe City God and Land Deity summoned a little ghost to deliver Chen Guangrui’s soul to the demon, who carried it to the Crystal Palace and presented it to the Dragon King. The Dragon King asked, “Young scholar, what is your name and family name? Where are you from? Why did you come here, only to be murdered?” Guangrui bowed respectfully and replied, “I am Chen E, courtesy name Guangrui, from Hongnong County, Haizhou. I was fortunate enough to become the top scholar in the recent imperial examinations and appointed governor of Jiangzhou. On my way to take up my post with my wife, we boarded a boat by the riverbank, only to be betrayed by the villain Liu Hong, who coveted my wife and murdered me, casting my body into the water. Great King, please save me!” Hearing this, the Dragon King said, “So it is! Sir, the golden carp you released earlier was none other than myself. You saved my life, and now that you’re in trouble, how could I possibly refuse to help?” He then had Guangrui’s body placed aside, inserting a magical bead into his mouth to preserve it intact, so that one day it could regain its spirit and seek vengeance. He added, “For now, your true soul shall temporarily serve as a chief official in my underwater realm.” Guangrui bowed deeply in gratitude, and the Dragon King hosted a banquet in his honor, which need not be detailed further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin loathed Liu the villain with every fiber of her being, wishing she could devour his flesh and flay his skin—but pregnant as she was, unsure whether the child was a boy or girl, she had no choice but to endure and comply for the time being. Before she knew it, they had arrived in Jiangzhou. Officials, clerks, and servants all came out to greet them. Local dignitaries arranged a grand banquet in the courthouse to celebrate. Liu Hong said, “My arrival here today is entirely due to your generous support.” The officials replied, “Your Excellency is highly talented and virtuous; naturally, you treat the people as your own children, keeping lawsuits simple and punishments light. We, your subordinates, are fortunate indeed—why be so modest?” After the banquet concluded, everyone dispersed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTime passed swiftly. One day, Liu Hong had urgent business far away, leaving the lady alone in the official residence, longing for her mother-in-law and husband. Sitting in the flower pavilion, she sighed deeply, suddenly feeling weary, with pain in her abdomen, and fainting to the ground. Unbeknownst to her, she gave birth to a son. Suddenly, a voice whispered in her ear: “Beloved daughter-in-law, heed my words carefully. I am the Star Lord of the South Pole, sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva’s command specifically to entrust this child to you. In the future, he will achieve great fame and distinction, far beyond the ordinary. When Liu the villain returns, he will surely harm this child, so you must protect him diligently. Your husband has already been rescued by the Dragon King; someday, husband and wife will reunite, mother and son will be reunited, and justice will finally be served. Remember my words well—wake up, wake up!” Having spoken these words, the voice vanished. The lady awoke, recalling every word clearly, clutching her child tightly, yet feeling utterly helpless. Suddenly, Liu Hong returned and, upon seeing the child, immediately tried to drown him. The lady quickly said, “It’s already late today; let’s wait until tomorrow to throw him into the river.” Fortunately, early the next morning, Liu Hong received urgent orders to leave on another distant errand. Secretly, the lady thought, “If we wait until the villain returns, this child’s life will be lost! Better to abandon him in the river now and let fate decide his destiny.”\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If Heaven takes pity on us and someone rescues this child, raising him as their own, perhaps we shall meet again someday.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But fearing it might be difficult to recognize him later, she bit her finger until it bled, writing a blood letter detailing her parents' names, origins, and the full story of their plight. She then bit off the little toe from the child's left foot, using it as a distinctive mark. Taking a close-fitting undershirt, she wrapped the baby in it and, seizing an opportune moment, carried him out of the official residence. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, so the young lady hurried to the riverside and burst into tears. Just as she was about to abandon the child, she suddenly noticed a wooden plank drifting lazily along the riverbank. Bowing toward the heavens in prayer, she carefully placed the baby onto the plank, secured him with a strap, tied the blood letter to his chest, and gently pushed the makeshift raft into the river, letting fate guide its course. With tears streaming down her face, she returned to the residence without further ado.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the child floated downstream on the wooden plank, drifting steadily until he came to rest at the foot of Jinshan Temple. The abbot of Jinshan Temple was a venerable monk named Faming, who had attained profound enlightenment through spiritual cultivation and mastered the subtle secrets of immortality. While meditating in deep contemplation, he suddenly heard the cries of a baby. His heart stirred, and he hurried to the riverside, where he saw a tiny infant sleeping peacefully on a piece of driftwood. Hastily, he rescued the child and, upon examining the blood letter clutched in the baby's hand, learned of his origins. He gave the child a nickname, Jiangliu, entrusted him to others for care, and carefully preserved the blood letter as a precious keepsake. Time flew by like an arrow, days and months passing swiftly, and before anyone realized it, Jiangliu had grown into an eighteen-year-old youth. The abbot then called him forward, shaved his head, and ordained him as a monk, giving him the Dharma name Xuanzang. After receiving the precepts and having his head touched, Xuanzang resolved firmly to pursue the path of enlightenment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, during the late spring season, everyone gathered beneath the shade of pine trees to listen to sutras, engage in meditation, and discuss profound teachings. At that very moment, a dissolute monk who indulged in meat and wine found himself utterly confounded by Xuanzang. Enraged, the monk lashed out, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You wretched creature! You don't even know your own name or your parents—what right do you have to meddle here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Hearing such harsh words, Xuanzang knelt before his master in the temple, tears streaming down his face, and pleaded earnestly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"All beings are born between heaven and earth, nourished by yin and yang and sustained by the five elements. It is only natural that one is born of a father and raised by a mother. How can there be a person in this world without parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He continued to implore his master repeatedly, begging to learn the names of his parents. The abbot finally said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you truly wish to find your parents, come with me to my quarters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang followed him to the abbot's chamber, where the elder climbed up to the rafters, retrieved a small box, and opened it to reveal the blood letter and the undershirt, handing them over to Xuanzang. As Xuanzang unfolded the blood letter and read it carefully, he finally learned the full details of his parents' names and the tragic circumstances surrounding their wrongful deaths. Upon finishing the reading, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How can I call myself human if I cannot avenge my parents' wrongs? For eighteen years, I've lived without knowing my birth parents, and only today do I discover that I have a mother. Had it not been for my master rescuing and nurturing me, how could I stand here today? Please allow me to go seek out my mother, and afterward, I will carry incense bowls on my head, rebuild the temple, and repay my master's immense kindness!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you wish to find your mother, take this blood letter and undershirt with you. Simply beg alms as you travel directly to the private residence in Jiangzhou, and there you shall surely meet your mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang accepted his master's instructions, disguised himself as a mendicant monk, and set off straight for Jiangzhou. Coincidentally, Liu Hong happened to be away on business, and fate seemed to bring mother and son together. Xuanzang arrived at the gate of the private residence, chanting sutras and calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Yin, meanwhile, had dreamt the previous night of a waning moon that had fully regained its roundness. She mused to herself, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother-in-law remains missing, my husband was murdered by bandits, and my son was cast into the river. If someone has adopted him, he must now be eighteen years old. Perhaps today, heaven has arranged for us to meet again—it cannot be mere coincidence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As she pondered these thoughts, she suddenly heard someone chanting sutras outside the residence, calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Seizing the opportunity, she stepped out and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"From where do you come?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am a humble monk, a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"So you are indeed a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple—\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and invited him inside, offering him a meal. As she observed his demeanor and speech closely, she noticed a striking resemblance to her late husband. She dismissed her maidservants and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Young master, did you become a monk from childhood, or did you enter the monastic life later in life? What is your full name, and do you still have living parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I did not become a monk in childhood, nor did I enter the priesthood in middle age. To tell you the truth, my grievances are as vast as the sky, and my hatred runs as deep as the sea! My father was treacherously murdered, and my mother was taken by bandits. My master, Abbot Faming, instructed me to come to the Jiangzhou residence and search for my mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is your mother's surname?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother's surname is Yin, her given name is Wenjiao; my father's surname is Chen, his given name is Guangrui; my childhood nickname was Jiangliu, and my Dharma name is Xuanzang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wenjiao—that is me! But what proof do you have to support your claim?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing that it was his mother, Xuanzang dropped to his knees and burst into tears: “If my mother doesn’t believe me, here’s proof—a blood-written undershirt!” Wenjiao took the undershirt and examined it carefully; sure enough, it was genuine. Mother and son embraced each other, weeping bitterly, and she urged him, “My son, hurry and leave at once!” Xuanzang replied, “For eighteen years I’ve never known my birth parents, and only today have I finally met my mother—how can I bear to part from her?” The young lady said, “My son, you must quickly make your escape! If Liu the bandit returns, he’ll surely take your life! Tomorrow I’ll pretend to fall ill, claiming that years ago I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk’s shoes, and I’ll come to your temple to fulfill that vow. At that time, I’ll have something important to tell you.” Xuanzang, following her advice, bowed farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, ever since seeing her son, the young lady had been filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry. One day, she suddenly feigned illness, refusing food and drink, and lay down in bed. When Liu Hong returned to the office and asked about the reason, she said, “When I was young, I made a vow to donate one hundred pairs of monk’s shoes. Five days ago, I dreamt of a monk holding a sharp blade, demanding those shoes, and ever since then I’ve felt unwell.” Liu Hong exclaimed, “Why didn’t you mention such a trivial matter earlier?” He immediately ordered Wang Zuo Ya and Li You Ya to convene in court: all households in Jiangzhou city were instructed to prepare one pair of monk’s shoes each, with a deadline of five days for completion. The people dutifully fulfilled the order. Then the young lady turned to Liu Hong and asked, “Now that the monk’s shoes are ready, which temple would be suitable for me to go and fulfill my vow?” Liu Hong replied, “In Jiangzhou there’s Jinshan Temple and Jiaoshan Temple—whichever temple you prefer, you may choose.” The young lady said, “I’ve long heard that Jinshan Temple is an excellent monastery, so I shall go there.” Liu Hong immediately summoned Wang and Li, ordering them to prepare a boat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady brought along her trusted attendants, boarded the boat, and as soon as the oars pushed off, they headed straight for Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, back at the temple, Xuanzang reported everything to Elder Faming, who was overjoyed upon hearing the tale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, a maid arrived first, announcing that the lady had come to the temple to fulfill her vow. All the monks came out to greet her.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady walked directly through the temple gates, paid homage to the Bodhisattva, and arranged a grand vegetarian feast. She then instructed her maids to place the monk’s shoes and socks on a tray. When she reached the main hall, she again lit incense and offered prayers, after which she asked Elder Faming to distribute the offerings among the monks. Once the monks had dispersed and the hall was empty, Xuanzang knelt forward. The young lady asked him to remove his shoes and socks, and indeed, a small toe was missing from his left foot. At that moment, the two embraced once more, weeping uncontrollably, and expressed their gratitude to the elder for raising him. Faming said, “Now that mother and son have reunited, there’s a risk that the villain might find out. You must quickly withdraw before disaster strikes.” The young lady added, “My son, I’m giving you this ring as a token. Head northwest toward Hongzhou, a journey of roughly fifteen hundred li. There, in Wanhuadian, you’ll find Granny Zhang, your father’s own mother. I’ve also written you a letter to deliver to the imperial palace in Tang’s capital, to the home of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, on the left side of the Golden Hall—those are your maternal grandparents. Hand my letter to your grandfather, and ask him to petition the Tang emperor, gather troops, capture this villain, avenge your father, and only then will your mother’s life be saved. I dare not linger here any longer, for fear that the villain might suspect me if I return late.” With that, she left the temple, boarded the boat, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang returned to the temple, weeping, and informed his master before bidding farewell immediately, heading straight for Hongzhou. Upon arriving at Wanhuadian, he asked the shopkeeper, Liu Xia’er, “Years ago, a guest named Chen from Jiangzhou stayed at your inn with his mother. How is she doing now?” Liu Xia’er replied, “She did stay at my inn, but later her eyesight failed, and for three or four years she didn’t pay me rent. Now she lives in a dilapidated kiln near the South Gate, begging daily on the streets to survive. That guest left long ago, and since then we’ve had no news of him whatsoever—no one knows why.” Upon hearing this, Xuanzang immediately went to the South Gate and found the old woman living in the broken kiln. The old woman exclaimed, “Your voice sounds just like my son, Chen Guangrui!” Xuanzang replied, “I’m not Chen Guangrui—I’m his son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother.” The old woman asked, “Why haven’t your parents come?” Xuanzang answered, “My father was beaten to death by bandits, and my mother was taken by force as their wife.” The old woman continued, “How did you know to come looking for me?” Xuanzang explained, “My mother sent me to find you. She gave me a letter and a ring.” The old woman took the letter and the ring, bursting into tears as she cried out, “My son came all this way for fame and success—I thought he’d betrayed us and forgotten his kindness, never imagining he’d been murdered!”And I am glad that the emperor has pity on me. After my son, today there are grandchildren looking for me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are your mother-in-law's eyes faint?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I cried so hard that my eyes fainted because I thought about your father all day long and I didn't see him coming.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the Sky: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and his parents' hatred cannot be avenged. Today, I took my mother's order to find my mother-in-law. If the sky shows my disciple's sincerity, I will keep my mother-in-law's eyes clear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After wishing, he licked the tip of his tongue and his mother-in-law's eyes. In a moment, my eyes lick open and still return to the same place. The mother-in-law looked at the young monk and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You are my grandson! It's just like my son Guang Rui!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law was happy and sad. Xuanzang took her mother-in-law out of the kiln door, went to Liu Xiaoer's shop, and put some money in a house to live with her mother-in-law. Then she entangled herself with her mother-in-law and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'll be back in less than a month.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Then he quit his mother-in-law and headed for the capital. He found Prime Minister Yin's Mansion on Huangcheng East Street and said to the door, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The little monk is a relative. Come to visit Xianggong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The door was informed of the prime minister, who said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have no relatives with the monk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The wife said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I dreamed last night that my daughter came home full of charming, unless my son-in-law came back with letters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister then taught the young monk to come to the hall. When the young monk saw the Prime Minister and his wife, he cried and bowed to the ground. He took out a book from his arms and handed it to the prime minister. The Prime Minister opened it, read it from the beginning, and cried bitterly. The lady asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What was the accident?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This Monk is my nephew and yours. Son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by thieves, and Mantang Jiao was forcibly taken as his wife by thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Madame listened and cried bitterly. The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Madam is worried. Come to the court to tell the Lord and personally command the troops. You must avenge your son-in-law.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The next day, the prime minister entered the dynasty and inspired the Tang King to say: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Today, Chen Guangrui, the top scholar of his son-in-law, led his family Xiaojiang to take office. He was killed by Liu Hong, a little water, and took his daughter as his wife. He pretended to be a son-in-law and became an official for many years. This is a change. His Majesty beggars immediately sent troops to eliminate thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" When the King of the Tang Dynasty saw that he was furious, he sent 60,000 Imperial troops to the Prime Minister Yin to supervise the soldiers. The Prime Minister led the decree out of the court, that is, he ordered soldiers to the teaching ground and headed for Jiangzhou. Xiao Xing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, but he did not realize he had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's soldiers and horses all went down to camp on the north bank. Starry night ordered the gold medal to be called to Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state sentenced two people. The Prime Minister told him that he knew about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before the sky was clear, Liu Hong's Yamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the Golden Drums were ringing, and the soldiers killed into the private office. Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured early. The Prime Minister handed down a military order to tie Liu Hong and his men to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister went straight into the main hall of the government office and sat down. Please ask the young lady to come out and meet. If the young lady wants to stay and go out, she will hang herself if she is ashamed of her father. Hearing this, Xuanzang hurriedly rescued his mother, knelt down on his knees and said to his mother, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Son and grandfather, unify the troops here and avenge your father. Today, the thief has been captured. Why did my mother want to die? If the mother dies, how can the child survive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister also went to the government to persuade him. The young lady said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I heard that the woman died from one thing. Tongfu has been killed by thieves, how can he be ashamed of being a thief? Because of the posthumous body, had to endure shame to steal life. Today, Xing'er has grown up and seen his old father take revenge for his daughter. What will he see! Only death can repay her husband's ear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is not my son's change of course with ups and downs. It is all because of a last resort. Why should I be ashamed!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Father and son hugged and cried, and Xuanzang also mourned. The Prime Minister wiped away his tears and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You two should stop worrying. I have captured the enemy thief now, and I will send it off.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That is, I got up and went to the Dharma Field. It happened that Jiangzhou Tongzhi also sent sentinels to take the water thief Li Biao.The prime minister was overjoyed and immediately ordered the soldiers to bring Liu Hong and Li Biao forward. Each was flogged severely with one hundred strokes, after which they confessed under duress, admitting their conspiracy years ago to murder Chen Guangrui. First, Li Biao was nailed onto a wooden donkey, dragged to the marketplace, and executed by being sliced into a thousand pieces, his head then displayed publicly as a warning. Next, Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang ferry crossing, the very spot where he had killed Chen Guangrui years ago. The prime minister, accompanied by the young lady and Xuanzang, personally went to the riverside, offering prayers toward the heavens. They then cruelly gouged out Liu Hong's heart and liver, using them as offerings for Guangrui, and burned a memorial text as part of the ritual.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe three stood by the river weeping bitterly, an act that soon alarmed the underwater realm. A sea patrol Yaksha quickly presented the memorial text to the Dragon King. After reading it, the Dragon King dispatched General Bie Wu to summon Guangrui. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sir,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said the Dragon King, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"congratulations! Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all at the riverside paying tribute to you. I shall now restore your soul. Moreover, I offer you one如意珠, two walking beads, ten lengths of fine silk, and a beaded jade belt. Today, you shall finally reunite with your wife, child, and mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui bowed repeatedly in gratitude. The Dragon King then instructed the Yaksha to carry Guangrui's body out of the river mouth and restore his soul. The Yaksha accepted the order and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin had finished mourning her husband and was about to throw herself into the water to end her life, but Xuanzang desperately grabbed hold of her, preventing her from doing so. In the midst of this chaos, suddenly a corpse floated up on the water's surface, drifting close to the riverbank. Miss Yin hurried forward to examine it and recognized her husband's body, bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone gathered around to watch, and they saw Guangrui slowly stretching his fists and legs, his body gradually coming back to life. Suddenly, he sat up, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Guangrui opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin, his father-in-law Prime Minister Yin, and the little monk all weeping beside him. Guangrui asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are you all here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Miss Yin replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Because you were murdered by bandits, and later I gave birth to our son. Fortunately, he was raised by the abbot of Jinshan Temple and eventually found me. I sent him to seek out your father, who learned of your fate and petitioned the court. He led troops here, captured the bandits, and just now, they took your heart and liver as offerings to you. I never imagined you would come back to life!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui explained, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's all because years ago, when we were at the Wanhuadeng shop, I bought and released that golden carp. Little did I know that carp was actually the Dragon King of these waters. When the villain pushed me into the river, it was thanks to him that I survived. Now he has restored my soul and bestowed upon me these treasures. And I never expected you to give birth to our son, nor that my father-in-law would avenge me. Truly, after enduring so much hardship, sweet happiness has finally arrived—a joy beyond measure!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpon hearing the news, all the officials came to congratulate them. The prime minister ordered a banquet to be prepared, thanking his subordinates before the army began its return journey. Arriving at Wanhuadeng, the prime minister ordered the troops to set up camp. Guangrui, accompanied by Xuanzang, went to Liu's shop to find his mother-in-law. That night, she had a dream: a withered tree blossomed, and magpies chirped incessantly behind her house. She thought, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Could it be my grandson returning?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Before she could finish her thoughts, Guangrui and his son appeared at the door. The little monk pointed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that my grandmother?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Upon seeing his aged mother, Guangrui immediately knelt down and prostrated himself. Mother and son embraced, weeping bitterly, and recounted everything that had happened. After settling the bill at the inn, they set off for the capital. Upon entering the prime minister's residence, Guangrui, Miss Yin, his mother, and Xuanzang all met the lady of the house. Overjoyed, she ordered her servants to prepare a grand feast in celebration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe prime minister declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us call today's banquet the Reunion Feast.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It truly was a joyful family gathering.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next morning, Emperor Tang ascended the throne, and Prime Minister Yin stepped forward to report in detail all that had transpired, recommending Guangrui for high office. The emperor approved the recommendation and immediately appointed Chen E as a scholar, entrusting him with state affairs. Xuanzang resolved to devote himself to Zen meditation and was sent to practice at Hongfu Temple. Later, Miss Yin calmly took her own life, and Xuanzang returned to Jinshan Temple to express gratitude to Abbot Faming. As for what happened afterward, we shall leave that for the next installment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Chapter Nine: Yuan Shoucheng's Brilliant Calculation, Free from Selfish Intentions; the Old Dragon King's Foolish Scheme Violates Heavenly Law\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPoem:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA great city in the capital, truly worth beholding,\\\\\\\\nEight rivers flow around the four mountains.\\\\\\\\nHow many emperors rose from this place;\\\\\\\\nSince ancient times, the world speaks of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis chapter specifically describes the great city of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, the site where emperors of successive dynasties established their capitals. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, the land has been adorned with colorful flowers, and eight rivers flow around the city. Thirty-six flower-lined alleys and seventy-two music pavilions stand proudly.According to the map of Hua and Yi, the world’s foremost region truly is a land of extraordinary beauty. Now, Emperor Taizong Wen of the Tang Dynasty has ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Longji Zhenguan. It has already been thirteen years since his coronation, and the current year is Ji Si. Not to mention the heroic figures who stand before him, safeguarding the realm and stabilizing the country, nor those outstanding talents who fought bravely to expand its borders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of two virtuous men living by the Jing River outside Chang’an city: one is a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other a woodcutter named Li Ding. Both are scholars who failed the imperial examinations but are literate mountain folk. One day, after selling their firewood in Chang’an and trading the carp from their baskets, they entered an inn together, enjoyed themselves until half-drunk, each carrying a bottle, and slowly strolled back along the banks of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Brother Li, I think those who strive for fame end up sacrificing their bodies for it; those who chase profit lose themselves in pursuit of gain; those who accept titles sleep with tigers by their side; and those who bask in favor carry snakes up their sleeves. When you come down to it, we’re better off enjoying our serene waters and verdant mountains, living freely and carefree, content with simplicity, letting fate guide us.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding replied, “Brother Zhang, you make a valid point. But your beautiful waters aren’t as good as my lush mountains.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nZhang Shao retorted, “Your lush mountains aren’t as fine as my beautiful waters.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo prove his point, he quoted a poem titled “Die Lian Hua”:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“On misty waters stretching ten thousand li, a tiny boat drifts alone, quietly moored beneath a lone awning, the voice of Xi Shi lingers round about. Free from worldly cares, cleansed of greed and fame, I leisurely pluck reeds and smartweeds by the willow-lined shore. A few sand terns delight my eyes, in willow groves and reed bays, my wife and children laugh with joy. After a peaceful sleep, the winds and waves seem playful—no honor, no disgrace, no worries at all.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding countered, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Die Lian Hua’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In a stretch of cloud-covered woods, pines bloom profusely; silently I listen to the warbling birds, their tongues as skillful as flutes. The red fades, the green grows rich—the spring is warm, yet summer swiftly arrives. Then autumn comes easily, changing everything; golden flowers bloom, perfect for admiring. And soon winter arrives sharp as a finger snap, yet I roam free through all four seasons, unbothered by anyone.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman said, “Your lush mountains can’t compare to my beautiful waters. Let me share a ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to illustrate how much better off we are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In the fairyland of clouds and water, life is complete; a boat with oars laid across is my home. Fresh scales I slice, green turtles I cook; purple crabs steamed, red shrimp boiled. Green bamboo shoots, water plantain sprouts—water caltrops and lotus roots are even more delightful. Tender lotus roots, aged lotus seeds, tender celery leaves—water chestnuts, water bamboo, and bird’s-eye flowers.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter replied, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to show how much better we have it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Towering peaks reach toward the horizon, a thatched hut is my home. Cured chicken, goose, crab, and turtle—wild boar, roe deer, hare, and deer surpass fish and shrimp. Chinese toon leaves, yellow catalpa buds—bamboo shoots and mountain tea are even more splendid. Purple plums, red peaches, ripe apricots and plums, sweet pears, sour jujubes, osmanthus blossoms.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman insisted, “Your lush mountains really can’t compete with my beautiful waters. Here’s another ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A little boat drifts wherever it may, amid countless layers of misty waves, fearless and free. Casting hooks and nets, I catch fresh fish, not greasy or oily, yet delicious beyond compare; old wife and young child gather round for reunion. With plenty of fish, I head to Chang’an market, trade for fine wine, and drink myself into a stupor. My raincoat serves as blanket on the autumn river, snoring peacefully, without a care, unattached to worldly honors or riches.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter retorted, “Brother Zhang, your beautiful waters still can’t match the joy of my mountain life. Here’s a ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A few thatched huts built beneath the hills, pines, bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids—how lovely they are! Through forests and over ridges, I search for dry firewood, no one scolds me, I sell as I please, more or less depending on the world. With the money earned, I buy wine and drink at will, savoring freedom in earthenware bowls and porcelain cups. Drunken and drowsy, I lie beneath the pines, unburdened, unconcerned, indifferent to rise or fall in this mortal world.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman concluded, “Brother Li, your mountain life can’t match the joy of my riverside business. Here’s a ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“The red smartweed blooms profusely under moonlight, yellow reeds sway wildly in the breeze. The azure sky stretches far, the Chu River flows empty and clear, stirring the reflections of stars in the pond. Big fish swim in schools into the net, small mandarin fish cluster around the hook. Once caught, they taste especially rich when cooked—laughing and joking, I roam the rivers and lakes.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter responded, “Brother Zhang, your riverside life still can’t match the joy of my mountain business. Here’s another ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Withered leaves and dead vines fill the paths, broken branches and old bamboo cover the hills. Wild vines and dried kudzu twine wildly, I gather them, tie them up, and carry them off. Worm-eaten hollow elm and willow, wind-broken pine and nanmu trees—\\\\\\\\nI collect them, pile them up for winter’s cold, and trade them for wine and money.”The fisherman said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Though your mountain may be comparable, it still can't match the serene elegance of my waters. Here's a poem to prove it: As the tide ebbs, a lone boat drifts away; at night's deep hour, the oarsman's song fades off. Under the crescent moon, my raincoat brings such quiet charm—wakeful gulls startled, yet unable to rise; colorful clouds part in the sky. Lying idly on the reed isle, with nothing to do, I linger until the sun climbs three poles high. Following my heart's desire, I arrange my days as I please; while courtiers shiver waiting for the watchman's call, how could they compare to my carefree spirit?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your waters' tranquil grace cannot rival the deeper serenity of my green mountains, and here's another poem to attest: On autumn paths, I stride forth with axe in hand; in evening coolness, I return bearing my load. Wildflowers tucked into my hair bring even greater wonder—parting clouds, I find my way; waiting for the moon, I knock at the gate. My young son and mountain wife greet me with joyful smiles; on a bed of grass and wooden pillow, I stretch and rest. Steaming pears and cooking millet, I quickly prepare; new brew matures in jars—truly, this deepens my tranquil heart!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman continued, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These are merely our trades, our means of sustenance. You lack the joys I find in leisure time, as this poem shows: Leisurely watching white cranes fly across the sky, I moor my boat by the stream and close the green door. Leaning against the cabin, I teach my child to twist fishing lines, and after rowing, spread the nets out with my wife. With calm resolve, I truly sense the waves have stilled; at ease, I naturally feel the breeze grow mild. A green raincoat and bamboo hat I wear at will—far better than donning purple robes in court.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yet your leisure time still doesn't match mine, as this poem also proves: Leisurely watching wispy clouds drift by, I sit alone in my thatched hut, closing the bamboo door. Without tasks, I instruct my child to read from scrolls; sometimes, I gather friends to play chess. When joy comes, I lean on my staff and sing along fragrant paths; when inspiration strikes, I carry my zither up to verdant heights. Straw sandals, hemp ropes, coarse cloth for bedding—such contentment far surpasses fine silken robes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Li Ding, we truly can enjoy light verses together without needing drums or golden goblets. Let's exchange a few lines each, and see how well we fishermen and woodcutters converse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Li Ding replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Zhang speaks most wisely; please begin with a verse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My boat rests in emerald waters amid misty ripples, my home lies deep in mountains and wild fields. I especially love spring floods over stream bridges, and most cherish morning mists among rocky peaks. Fresh carp from Longmen often graced my pot, dry firewood charred under daily flames. Fishing nets provide various ways to support old age, carrying poles sustain me till the end. In my small boat, I lie back watching geese take flight, along grassy paths slanting, listening to cranes cry out. In the marketplace of words, I hold no stake; in seas of right and wrong, my trace grows faint. By the stream, cloths hang drying like brocade, on stones I sharpen axes sharp as blades. Under autumn moons, I often fish alone; in spring mountains, no one meets me in solitude. When fish abound, I trade them for wine to share with my wife; leftover firewood sells to buy more liquor for my children. Singing and sipping freely, I let loose and roam; long songs and sighs, I yield to winds that toss and turn. Calling brothers and shipmates, I invite fellow travelers; friends and companions gather with rustic folk. Drinking games and fist-clenching contests pass cups repeatedly; card games and wordplay fill the hours with laughter. Cooking shrimp and crabs brings daily delight, stir-frying duck and braising chicken makes every day rich. My simple wife brews tea with playful ease, my mountain wife cooks meals with calm assurance. At dawn, I raise my staff to stir gentle waves, at sunrise, I carry firewood over rushing streams. After rain, I don my raincoat to catch live carp; in wind, I wield my axe to fell dead pines. Hiding from the world, I feign foolishness and dullness, concealing my name and living mute and deaf.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Li, I took the liberty of starting first; now it's your turn—please begin a couplet, and I shall follow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A madman of mountains and wilds, pretending madness in wind and moonlight, an old man lingering proudly in rivers and lakes. Free time belongs to those who live carefree lives, free from gossip, rejoicing in peace. On moonlit nights, I sleep soundly in a thatched hut; in dusk, a light bamboo cloak shields my body. Lost in joy, I make friends with pine and plum, gladly pledge with gulls and egrets. No schemes for fame and fortune occupy my mind; no sounds of strife reach my ears. A sip of fragrant homemade wine at any hour, three meals of wild vegetable soup each day. Two bundles of firewood sustain my life, a fishing rod provides my livelihood. I casually call my child to sharpen steel axes, quietly summon my simple lad to mend old cloths. In spring, I love watching willows turn green, when seasons blend, I delight in reeds and rushes. In summer, I escape the heat by tending new bamboo shoots, in June, I cool off picking tender water caltrops. When frost descends, chickens grow plump and ready for slaughter, on Double Ninth Festival, crabs thrive and are cooked just in time. In winter, I still sleep late as the sun rises, through the Nine Cold Days, I stay warm without steaming. Through all eight seasons, I let my nature run free in the mountains; in four seasons, I indulge my heart by the lake. Gathering firewood brings the joy of immortals, fishing bears no mark of worldly ties. Outside my door, wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues; before my boat, green waters ripple smoothly. Content in my humble state, I need not speak of high office; my settled nature surpasses even a city ten miles wide.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“Ten miles of city walls, high defenses and strict orders; three high officials, their status renowned, listening to imperial edicts. To enjoy mountains and waters is truly rare—how grateful we are to Heaven, Earth, and the gods!” As they exchanged verses and linked their poetic lines, they reached the point where their paths diverged and bowed farewell to each other. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, take care on your journey! Be cautious when climbing the mountain, watch out for tigers. If any danger should arise, tomorrow’s street might see one less old friend!” Upon hearing this, Li Ding flew into a rage: “You lazy scoundrel! True friends share life and death together—how dare you curse me like that? If I meet with harm from a tiger, you’ll surely face the waves and be swept away by the river!” Zhang Shao replied, “I swear I’ll never be tossed about by rivers again.” Li Ding retorted, “Heaven holds unpredictable storms, and fate brings temporary fortune or misfortune. How can you guarantee you’ll remain unscathed?” Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, though you speak thus, you haven’t grasped the truth; my business, at least, offers some certainty—I’m certain I won’t encounter such trouble.” Li Ding asked, “Your livelihood on the water is extremely dangerous and perilous, shrouded in mystery and obscurity—what certainty can there be?” Zhang Shao replied, “You simply don’t understand. In Chang’an city, on West Gate Street, there’s a fortune-teller who sells divination. Every day I bring him a golden carp, and he secretly passes me a lesson, guiding me by direction, always hitting the mark. Today I went to buy another reading, and he instructed me to cast my net east of Jinghe Bay’s bend and set my line along the western bank—surely I’ll return with a boatload of fish and shrimp. Tomorrow I’ll come into the city, sell my catch, buy wine, and meet up with you again.” With these words, the two parted ways.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they spoke, someone was lurking in the grass. It turned out that a night demon patrolling the waters of the Jing River had overheard the talk about hitting the mark every time. He quickly rushed back to the Crystal Palace and urgently reported to the Dragon King:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Trouble! Trouble!” The Dragon King asked, “What kind of trouble?” The night demon replied, “While patrolling the riverbank, I heard two fishermen chatting. As they parted, their words were quite alarming. One fisherman said there’s a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an city who makes the most accurate predictions. Every day he gives him a carp, and the fortune-teller secretly teaches him how to hit the mark every single time. If his predictions prove true, won’t he end up wiping out all the aquatic creatures? How then can our underwater palace maintain its splendor, and how can we continue leaping through waves and assisting Your Majesty’s power?” The Dragon King was furious and immediately drew his sword, ready to march on Chang’an and destroy this fortune-teller. But just then, dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp ministers and crab officials, shad generals, mandarin fish lieutenants, and carp prime ministers stepped forward and jointly petitioned:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Your Majesty, please calm down. As the saying goes, words heard casually should not be taken at face value. If Your Majesty goes now, clouds will surely gather, rain will surely fall, and the people of Chang’an may be frightened, drawing blame from Heaven. Your Majesty’s presence is mysterious and unpredictable, capable of infinite transformations—but why not simply transform into a scholar and visit Chang’an yourself? If such a person exists, we can deal with him later; but if he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be unjust to harm others unnecessarily?” The Dragon King heeded their advice, laid down his sword, refrained from summoning clouds or rain, stepped ashore, and transformed himself into a scholar dressed in white, truly majestic and imposing, towering above the valleys and reaching toward the sky. His gait was dignified and proper, his conduct precise and upright. His speech followed Confucius and Mencius, his manners reflected the elegance of King Wen of Zhou. He wore a jade-colored robe and a leisurely headscarf with a single character embroidered on it. Setting off, he strode through the clouds and arrived directly on West Gate Street in Chang’an. There he saw a crowd gathered, bustling and noisy, filled with lively discussions: “Those born in the Year of the Dragon clash with those born in the Year of the Tiger. Though the combinations of Yin-Chen-Si-Hai are considered harmonious, what’s feared is the day clashing with the ruler of the year.” Hearing this, the Dragon King realized this must be the fortune-teller’s place. He stepped forward, pushed through the crowd, and peered inside. What he saw was a room adorned with pearls and jewels on all four walls, rich brocade and silk filling the hall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fragrance of precious incense never ceased, and the porcelain bottles held crystal-clear water. On either side hung paintings by Wang Wei, while above the seat hung an image of Guiguzi.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Duanxi inkstone, golden smoke ink, matched perfectly with a brush of frosty bristles; the Fire Pearl Forest and Guo Pu’s numerology stood beside the newly revised court texts. Six Lines mastered thoroughly, Eight Trigrams understood perfectly. Able to know heaven and earth, skilled at discerning spirits and gods. A compass arranged noon and midnight precisely, a belly full of stars clearly arrayed. Indeed, future events and past matters were as clear as moonlit mirrors; which families prospered and which declined, judged as clearly as divine insight. Foreseeing misfortune and determining good fortune, pronouncing death and proclaiming life. Speaking swiftly as wind and rain, writing so that ghosts and gods trembled. The sign read: “Divine Lessons, Master Yuan Shoucheng.” Who was this man? He turned out to be none other than Yuan Shoucheng, uncle of Yuan Tiangang, the current Imperial Astronomer and Chief of the Bureau of Astronomy.Indeed, the gentleman had an extraordinary appearance, graceful demeanor, and his fame spread throughout the land; his skills were unrivaled in Chang'an. The Dragon King entered and met with the gentleman. After exchanging formal greetings, he invited the Dragon to take a seat, and a young attendant presented tea. The gentleman then asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What brings you here today?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've come to consult you about the weather forecast for tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman immediately drew a divination chart from his sleeve and declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Clouds obscure the mountaintops, mist veils the treetops. If you're asking about rain, it will surely fall tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King pressed further, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At what exact time will it rain tomorrow? And how much rainfall can we expect?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tomorrow at Chen hour clouds will gather, at Si hour thunder will roll, at Wu hour rain will begin, and by Wei hour the rain will be sufficient, totaling three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This cannot be taken lightly! If it truly rains tomorrow according to your predicted timing and amount, I'll reward you with fifty taels of gold as a token of gratitude. But if it doesn't rain, or if the timing or amount is even slightly off, let me tell you plainly—I'll smash your facade, tear down your signboard, and drive you out of Chang'an immediately, never again allowed to deceive the people!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman cheerfully responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Very well, I accept your challenge. Please rest assured, the rain will certainly arrive tomorrow as predicted.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Dragon King took his leave, departed Chang'an, and returned to the Water Palace. The lesser water deities greeted him and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How was your visit to that fortune-teller?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh yes, indeed! What a smooth-talking fellow! I asked him when it would rain, and he confidently predicted tomorrow's rain. When I pressed him for specific times and amounts, he said clouds would form at Chen hour, thunder would strike at Si hour, rain would start at Wu hour, and by Wei hour the rainfall would reach three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points. So I made a wager with him: if his prediction comes true, I'll give him fifty taels of gold as a reward; but if there's even the slightest discrepancy, I'll destroy his facade, kick him out, and forbid him from ever deceiving people in Chang'an again!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The aquatic creatures all laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty is the Grand Master of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God in charge of rain—only you know whether it will rain or not. How dare he speak such nonsense? That fortune-teller is sure to lose! He's bound to lose!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the dragon princes, grandsons, and fish, carp, and crabs were still laughing and discussing this matter, they suddenly heard a voice echoing from mid-air: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial decree!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Everyone looked up and saw a golden-clad warrior holding an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, heading straight toward the Water Palace. Startled, the Dragon King quickly straightened his robes, lit incense, and respectfully received the decree.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the golden-clad warrior returned to the heavens, the Dragon King expressed his gratitude, opened the sealed document, and read aloud: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Imperial Edict to the General of the Eight Rivers, commanding thunder and lightning; tomorrow you shall bestow rain to benefit the city of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The edict precisely matched the timing and rainfall amounts predicted by the gentleman, leaving the Dragon King utterly shaken and terrified. After regaining his composure, he addressed the aquatic beings: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There truly are such spiritual individuals in this world! He truly possesses the ability to communicate with heaven and earth—there's no disputing it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe strategist Shiji reported, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty, rest assured. What difficulty could there be in defeating him? I have a small plan that will silence that fellow once and for all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King asked for details, and the strategist replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If we alter the timing of the rain slightly and reduce the amount just a bit, his predictions will clearly be inaccurate. Won't that be enough to prove him wrong? Then we can tear down his signboard, chase him away, and there'll be no trouble at all!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King approved the strategy without hesitation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, he summoned Feng Bo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu, and ascended into the nine heavens above Chang'an. At the appointed time, clouds began to form at Si hour, thunder rumbled at Wu hour, rain fell at Wei hour, and finally ceased at Shen hour—but the total rainfall amounted to only three feet and forty points, one hour earlier than predicted and three inches and eight points less than promised. After issuing orders for his generals to withdraw, he transformed himself back into the guise of a refined scholar dressed in white and headed straight for Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling shop on West Gate Street. Without a word, he smashed the shop's signboard, brush, inkstone, and everything else. Meanwhile, the gentleman calmly sat in his chair, completely unfazed. The Dragon King then picked up a door panel and began striking and shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You deceitful charlatan who spreads false prophecies and misleads the masses! Your divinations are useless, your words absurd! Today's predicted timing and rainfall don't match reality, yet you still sit there boldly. Leave now, or I'll spare your life no longer!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Yet Shoucheng remained utterly fearless, raising his head to the sky and coldly laughing, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've committed no crime, but you, on the other hand, very much have! You may fool others, but you can't fool me. I know exactly who you are—you're not a scholar at all, but the Dragon King of the Jing River. You violated the Jade Emperor's decree by altering the timing and reducing the rainfall, thus breaking heavenly law!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“You’re standing on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, where a fatal blow is inevitable—yet you still dare to scold me here?” Upon hearing this, the Dragon King was seized with fear, his hair standing on end. Hastily dropping the door panel, he straightened his clothes, bowed deeply, and knelt before the master, saying, “Please don’t take offense, Master. Those earlier words were merely spoken in jest; who could have foreseen that falsehood would become reality, and that I’d truly violated heavenly law? What can be done now? I beg you, Master, please save me!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t let you go.” Shoucheng replied, “I cannot save you myself, but I can point out a path for you to reincarnate.” The dragon said, “I humbly request your guidance.” The master continued, “Tomorrow at the third hour of noon, you are scheduled to appear before Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official, to be executed. If you truly wish to keep your life, you must quickly go and plead with Emperor Taizong of Tang, who reigns today. Wei Zheng is the chancellor under the Tang emperor; only by gaining his personal favor can you ensure safety.” Hearing this, the Dragon King bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnaware of how time had passed, the sun had already set in the west, and the moon rose high in the sky. One could see: mist condensed, mountains turned purple, crows weary as they returned home; travelers far from home sought refuge in inns. New geese perched on sandbanks by the ferry landing, and the Milky Way appeared. The watchman urged the passing of the night, while in the lonely village, lamplight flickered without flame. Smoke curled gently from hearths in quiet monasteries, and within butterfly dreams, people vanished from sight. The moon shifted, casting flower shadows onto the railing, stars twinkled wildly. The sound of dripping water marked the hours, and before one knew it, the deep night had already reached its midpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King of the Jing River did not return to his underwater palace. Instead, he remained in mid-air, waiting until around midnight, when he gathered his clouds and dispersed his mists, heading straight for the entrance of the imperial palace. At that very moment, Emperor Taizong was dreaming he had stepped outside the palace gates, walking beneath the moonlit flowers. Suddenly, the Dragon King transformed into human form and knelt before him, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong asked, “Who are you? How can I save you?” The Dragon King replied, “Your Majesty is a true dragon, while I am an ordinary dragon. Because I’ve broken heavenly law, I’m due to be executed by Your Majesty’s virtuous minister, Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. That’s why I’ve come to beg you—I implore Your Majesty to save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong said, “If Wei Zheng is to carry out the execution, then I can indeed save you. Go with peace of mind.” Overjoyed, the Dragon King bowed deeply in gratitude and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, after waking from his dream, Emperor Taizong couldn’t stop thinking about it. By dawn, at the third watch, Taizong convened court, gathering officials from both civil and military ranks. There, one could see:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmoke veiled the Phoenix Pavilion, fragrant incense filled the Dragon Tower. Light shimmered on the vermilion throne, clouds brushed past the emerald canopy. Ruler and ministers harmonized as though they were Yao and Shun, ritual music and decorum approached the grandeur of Han and Zhou. Courtiers held lamps, palace maids fanned themselves, their reflections glowing brightly; peacock screens and Kylin halls sparkled everywhere. All cried out “Long live the Emperor!” and offered blessings for ten thousand years. Three silent whips cracked, and all bowed in ceremonial attire before the imperial crown. Palace flowers bloomed brilliantly, their heavenly fragrance filling the air; willows along the embankment swayed gently, accompanied by imperial music. Pearl curtains and jade drapes hung high, secured by golden hooks; dragon-and-phoenix fans and mountain-and-river banners adorned the royal carriage as it paused. Civil officials stood elegant and refined, military generals proud and alert. The imperial road distinguished high from low, and ranks lined up on the vermilion platform. Golden seals and purple ribbons honored three great elephants, symbolizing enduring prosperity for countless ages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce the officials had finished their greetings and dispersed into their respective groups, Emperor Taizong, with eyes like phoenixes and dragon pupils, carefully examined each one from head to toe. Among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui, and others; among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaogin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, Qin Shubao, and many more—all dignified and solemn, yet Wei Zheng, the chancellor, was conspicuously absent. Emperor Taizong summoned Xu Shiji to the throne and said, “Last night, I had a strange dream. I dreamed someone came forward to pay homage, claiming to be the Dragon King of the Jing River, who had broken heavenly law and was due to be executed by Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. He begged me to save him, and I promised to do so. Yet today, Wei Zheng is nowhere to be seen among the officials assembled. Why is that?”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShiji replied, “This dream must be taken seriously. Wei Zheng will arrive shortly; Your Majesty must not let him leave the palace. Only by keeping him here for another day can we save the dragon from the dream.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDelighted, Emperor Taizong immediately issued an edict, ordering the imperial messenger to summon Wei Zheng to court.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Wei Zheng was at home, observing the celestial signs at night, burning precious incense, when suddenly he heard the cry of cranes echoing from the nine heavens. It was an envoy sent by Heaven, bearing a golden decree from the Jade Emperor, instructing him to execute the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream at the third hour of noon. Grateful for Heaven’s grace, Wei Zheng had already fasted and bathed, testing his wisdom sword and summoning his spiritual essence within his residence, which is why he hadn’t attended court. When the imperial messenger arrived with the decree, he was overcome with fear and anxiety, yet dared not disobey the emperor’s command. Thus, he hastily dressed and belted himself, taking the decree with him as he hurried to court, where he prostrated himself before the emperor and confessed his guilt.Emperor Tang issued an edict, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I hereby pardon you and declare you innocent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At that time, the ministers had not yet adjourned the court session. However, upon hearing these words, the emperor ordered the curtains to be drawn back and dismissed the assembly, leaving only Wei Zheng behind. He was summoned to the Golden Hall and then invited into the private audience chamber, where they first discussed strategies for ensuring peace within the realm and plans for stabilizing the country. As it neared the end of the fourth hour and the beginning of the fifth, the emperor instructed a palace attendant to bring out a large chessboard, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us play a game, my wise minister.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The imperial consorts promptly brought forth the chessboard and set it up on the royal desk. Wei Zheng gratefully accepted the honor and immediately began playing chess with Emperor Tang.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for the outcome of the game, we shall leave that for the next installment to reveal.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"usage\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"inputTokens\\\\\\\":1004,\\\\\\\"outputTokens\\\\\\\":1261,\\\\\\\"totalTokens\\\\\\\":2265}},\\\\\\\"httpStatusCode\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"requestId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"C2D45266-3135-1A06-AD7F-69E782ED596F\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\":true},\\\\\\\"headers\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"access-control-allow-origin\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"*\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Fri, 12 Sep 2025 07:58:46 GMT\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"vary\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Accept-Encoding\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"x-acs-request-id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"C2D45266-3135-1A06-AD7F-69E782ED596F\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"content-type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"application/json;charset=utf-8\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"access-control-expose-headers\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"*\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"x-acs-trace-id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"20ab10e70295f6562ada5fe8d9f3eca7\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"statusCode\\\\\\\":200}\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\\\\"body\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"data\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"translation\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"I ask: how many countless inquiries have we made at the Zen gate, only to find ourselves aged in vain at last? Grinding bricks into mirrors, piling up snow for sustenance—how many youthful years have we thus lost in delusion? Swallowing the vast ocean with a hair, fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed—why do we still wear golden crowns and forced smiles? When enlightenment dawns, we transcend the ten stages and three vehicles; yet if we linger, we remain trapped within the four realms of existence and six paths. Who has heard, beneath the shadowless tree before the cliff of utter emptiness, the cuckoo’s cry heralding spring’s dawn? The Caosi trail is perilous, and the clouds over Jiling run deep; here, old friends’ voices fade away. On cliffs of thousand-zhang ice, five-petaled lotuses bloom, and incense curls from the ancient temple’s hanging curtains. At that moment, when we discern the source and stream, we shall behold the Dragon King’s Three Treasures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis poem is titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Su Wu Slow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It tells of our Buddha, Shakyamuni, bidding farewell to the Jade Emperor and returning to the sacred abode of Leiyin. There, he found three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great vajras, and countless bodhisattvas, each holding banners, canopies, wondrous treasures, and celestial flowers, arrayed in the spiritual realm of Spirit Mountain beneath the twin banyan trees to greet him. Ascending upon auspicious clouds, Shakyamuni addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"With profound wisdom, I have manifested throughout the three realms. The fundamental nature is ultimately tranquil and extinguished, identical to the void, devoid of all things. To subdue the rebellious monkey was no easy task; few could comprehend it. Birth and death begin with names, and phenomena are as they appear.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Having spoken, he emitted rays of sarira light, filling the sky with forty-two radiant white rainbows stretching north and south. Upon seeing this, the crowd prostrated themselves in reverence. Soon after, auspicious clouds gathered, forming a lotus throne of supreme quality, upon which he sat serenely. The three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight vajras, and four bodhisattvas approached, palms joined in prayer, and asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who was it that stirred up chaos in Heaven and disturbed the peach banquet?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Shakyamuni replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"That fellow is a demonic monkey born on Flower Fruit Mountain, whose crimes are immeasurable and beyond description. Even the heavenly generals could not subdue him, though Erlang captured him. Even Laozi's fiery refining could not harm him. When I arrived, he was amidst the thunder gods, flaunting his might and spirit. I stopped the fighting, questioned him about his origins. He claimed supernatural powers, the ability to transform, and to ride the somersault cloud, covering one hundred and eight thousand li in a single leap. We made a wager: if he couldn't escape my grasp, I would seize him and imprison him under Five Elements Mountain. The Five Emperors opened their golden palaces and jade chambers, inviting me to take the chief seat and holding a grand assembly to honor me, after which I departed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe crowd rejoiced upon hearing this, praising him profusely. After expressing gratitude, they dispersed into their respective groups, each resuming their duties and enjoying pure bliss. Indeed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAuspicious mists fill the land of India, rainbow light surrounds the honored one. In the West, he is called first—the formless Dharma King! Often we see mystical monkeys offering fruit, deer carrying flowers; green phoenixes dance, colorful phoenixes sing; sacred turtles present longevity, cranes capture medicinal herbs. Enjoying the Pure Land of Jetavana, partaking in the dragon palace's realm of Dharma. Flowers bloom daily, fruits ripen at every hour, cultivating tranquility and returning to truth, practicing Zen with genuine results. Neither annihilation nor birth, neither increase nor decrease. Mist and rosy clouds drift freely back and forth, unaffected by cold or heat, time itself forgotten.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the poem says:\\\\\\\\nFree to come and go, carefree and at ease, free from fear and sorrow. In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, all is open and clear; in the great thousandfold world, there is neither spring nor autumn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, while residing between the sacred mountain of Leiyin and the moonlit Spirit Mountain, the Buddha summoned all the Buddhas, Arhats, protectors, bodhisattvas, vajras, monks, nuns, and others, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Since subduing the rebellious monkey and pacifying Heaven, I have remained unaware of the passage of time, yet I estimate half a millennium has passed in the mortal realm, and now it is the full-moon day of early autumn. I possess a precious basin filled with a hundred varieties of flowers and a thousand kinds of exotic fruits, among other treasures. How shall we celebrate this 'Ullambana Festival' together with the Dharma?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Each member of the assembly joined their palms, bowed three times before the Buddha, and understood his intention. Then, Shakyamuni instructed Ananda to carry the basin of flowers and fruits, while Ksitigarbha scattered offerings, filling the crowd with gratitude. Everyone offered poems in thanks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of blessings says:\\\\\\\\nBlessings shine brightly before the revered one, blessings embrace the depths and extend far and wide. Boundless virtue endures as long as the earth, blessed connections link us to heaven. Fields of blessing expand yearly, the sea of fortune grows deeper with each passing year. Blessings fill the universe, abundant shade and endless growth, ever complete and boundless.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe poem of prosperity says:\\\\\\\\nProsperity weighs as heavily as mountains, the colorful phoenix sings its song. Prosperity brings timely good fortune, like the evening star shining brightly. Adding ten thousand measures of wealth ensures health and well-being, enjoying a thousand vessels of peace. Salaries rival heaven, eternally secure, names as vast as the sea, ever clearer. Thoughts of prosperity inspire admiration, titles of honor spread glory across myriad nations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The longevity poem says:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The star of longevity presents colorful offerings to the Buddha. From here, the realm of longevity shines with splendor. Plates brimming with fruits of longevity emit auspicious radiance, and freshly picked flowers of longevity adorn the lotus pedestal. The poems of longevity are elegant and full of wonders, while the melodies of longevity harmonize beautifully with talented voices. Longevity extends as long as the sun and moon, and may it be as vast and serene as mountains and seas.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\After all the Bodhisattvas finished their offerings, they respectfully requested the Buddha to clearly explain the fundamental principles and trace the origins. The Buddha slightly opened his compassionate mouth, expounded the great Dharma, and proclaimed the true fruit, lecturing on the profound scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the perfection of the Five Skandhas. At that moment, heavenly dragons circled around, and flowers rained down in profusion. Indeed: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Zen mind brightly illuminates the moon over a thousand rivers, and true nature embraces the vastness of ten thousand miles of sky.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After finishing his lecture, the Buddha addressed the assembly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"In the four great continents I now manifest, sentient beings differ in goodness and evil from place to place. In the Eastern Continent of Jambudvipa, people revere heaven and earth, with clear minds and calm spirits. In the Northern Continent of Uttarakuru, though fond of their own kin, they merely struggle for survival, possessing simple natures and limited aspirations, rarely indulging in excess. In the Western Continent of Aparagodaniya, people neither covet nor kill, nurturing their qi and cultivating inner spirit; though lacking supreme truth, everyone enjoys a long life. But in the Southern Continent of Kalirupa, greed, lust, and delight in misfortune prevail, with much killing and strife—truly a battlefield of tongues and a sea of slander and evil. Now I have the Tripitaka scriptures, which can persuade people to do good.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Upon hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas clasped their hands in reverence and approached the Buddha, asking: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What are the three collections of the Tripitaka scriptures?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have one collection of Dharma, discussing heaven; one collection of Vinaya, speaking of earth; and one collection of Sutra, guiding ghosts. Together, these three collections comprise thirty-five volumes, totaling 15,144 scrolls, representing the path to cultivation and the gateway to righteousness. I intend to send them to the Eastern Land, but alas, the beings there are foolish, slandering the true words and failing to understand the essence of my teachings, neglecting the authentic Yoga tradition. How can we find someone powerful enough to journey to the Eastern Land, seek out a sincere believer, guide him through hardships across thousands of mountains and distant waters, bring him to me to obtain the true scriptures, and perpetually spread them in the Eastern Land? This would indeed be a blessing as vast as mountains and a fortune as deep as the sea. Who would be willing to undertake such a journey?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At this point, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva stepped forward to the lotus pedestal, bowed three times before the Buddha, and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your disciple, though unworthy, is willing to go to the Eastern Land and find someone to retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" All present looked up at the Bodhisattva:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Perfect in virtue and wisdom, his golden body is filled with intelligence. Beaded garlands hang gracefully, fragrant rings gleam with precious light, dark clouds cleverly form coiled dragons, and embroidered ribbons gently flutter like colorful phoenix feathers. A jade clasp adorns his plain silk robe, surrounded by auspicious radiance; a brocade skirt and golden cords bring forth auspicious energy. His brows resemble crescent moons, his eyes like twin stars. Five faces naturally express joy, and his vermilion lips are touched with a hint of red. The vase of pure nectar overflows year after year, and the willow branch inserted askew remains ever green. He resolves eight difficulties and saves countless beings with great compassion; thus he dwells atop great mountains, resides in the South Sea, rescues those in suffering by responding to their cries, universally praised and answered, revered by thousands of saints and spirits. His heart delights in purple bamboo, and his nature cherishes fragrant vines. He is the compassionate lord of Mount Luojia, the living Avalokiteshvara in the Cave of Tidal Sounds.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Seeing this, the Buddha was overjoyed and said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No one else can go; only the venerable Avalokiteshvara, with his vast supernatural powers, is capable of undertaking this mission.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva asked: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If I go to the Eastern Land, do you have any instructions for me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Buddha replied: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"On this journey, you must carefully examine the roads, not traveling through the heavens, but rather among clouds and mists. As you pass mountains and rivers, remember the distances and details of the route, and give careful guidance to the scripture seeker. Fearing that the sincere believer may find the journey difficult, I shall provide you with five treasures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Then he ordered Ananda and Kashyapa to bring forth a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"brocade kasaya robe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nine-ringed staff,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" handing them to the Bodhisattva and saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This robe and staff can be personally used by the scripture seeker. If he comes here with firm resolve, wearing my robe will prevent him from falling into reincarnation, and holding my staff will protect him from harm.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The Bodhisattva received these items with reverence, and the Buddha then took three headbands and handed them to the Bodhisattva, saying: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These treasures are called 'tightening bands.' Though there are three identical ones, each is used differently. I have three incantations of 'Golden Tightening Seal.' If on the road you encounter powerful demons, you must persuade them to reform and become disciples of the scripture seeker. If they refuse to obey, you may place this band on their head, and it will naturally take root in their flesh. By reciting the appropriate incantation, their eyes will swell, their head will ache, and their foreheads will split open, forcing them to enter my fold.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing these words, the Bodhisattva joyfully bowed and stepped back, immediately summoning Huai'an the Pilgrim to accompany him. Huai'an wielded a solid iron staff weighing a thousand jin, serving as a mighty demon-slaying warrior at the Bodhisattva's side. The Bodhisattva then wrapped the Mirror Lake Robe into a bundle and instructed Huai'an to carry it on his back. Concealing the golden ring, the Bodhisattva took up his copper clapper and set off directly down from Spirit Mountain. This journey would bring about a significant outcome: the Buddha's disciple would return to fulfill his original vow, and Elder Golden Cicada would wrap himself in sandalwood robes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain, he was greeted by the Great Immortal of the Golden Summit at Yuzhen Temple, who stood at the temple gate to offer tea. The Bodhisattva dared not linger long and said to the Great Immortal, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have received the Buddha's command to travel eastward to seek out the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Great Immortal asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"When will this pilgrim arrive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is uncertain—perhaps within two or three years, or possibly sooner.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" With that, he bade farewell to the Great Immortal, traveling through clouds and mist, carefully noting the route along the way. A poem bears witness to this journey:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Seeking across ten thousand miles without a word,\\\\\\\\nWho can claim complete success when desire remains unfulfilled?\\\\\\\\nTo seek others seems so effortless—\\\\\\\\nIs this not fate, destined for me all my life?\\\\\\\\nThe Way is taught with methods, yet without faith, even truth becomes empty rumor.\\\\\\\\nI pledge my heart and soul to find companionship;\\\\\\\\nI know surely ahead lies an encounter meant by destiny.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs master and disciple continued their journey, they suddenly came upon the Weak Water River, a vast expanse marking the boundary of the Quicksand River. The Bodhisattva remarked:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My disciple, this place proves truly difficult to traverse. How could a mortal with impure flesh and blood possibly cross over?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Huai'an asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Master, how far does this river stretch?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As the Bodhisattva paused to gaze, he saw:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"To the east it connects with sandy deserts, reaching both eastern and western lands; to the south it extends to Ugo, and to the north it leads to the Tartars. Eight hundred li lie along its length, while its breadth stretches for countless miles. The water flows like the earth turning over, and the waves surge like mountains rising on their backs. Vast and boundless, desolate and endless, its roar echoes for ten li, and its floodwaters rise ten thousand feet high. Even celestial rafts cannot reach here, nor can lotus leaves float upon its surface. Withered grasses bend beneath the slanting sun, yellow clouds obscure the long embankments. Who among merchants dares to travel here? Where do fishermen find shelter? On the flat sands no geese alight, and from distant shores come the cries of apes. Only the red smartweed flowers know the beauty of this scene, and the delicate fragrance of white duckweed lingers faintly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the Bodhisattva surveyed the area, a loud splash erupted from the river, and a hideous demon leaped forth from the waters. Its appearance was truly monstrous:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIts skin neither green nor black, but dull and gloomy; its body neither tall nor short, barefoot and sinewy. Its eyes gleamed like twin lamps at the hearth, its mouth forked like a butcher's cleaver. Fangs protruded like blades, and fiery hair stood disheveled. It roared like thunder, and its feet moved swiftly as if driven by a rolling wind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster brandished a magical staff and rushed ashore, attempting to seize the Bodhisattva. But Huai'an blocked him with his solid iron club, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Halt!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster raised his staff in response, and the two clashed by the Quicksand River. This fierce battle was truly astonishing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMu Zha's iron club protected the righteous path, displaying divine power; the monster's demon-slaying staff fought valiantly. Two silver serpents danced along the riverbank, and two divine beings charged toward the shore. One wielded might over the Quicksand, demonstrating extraordinary skill; the other defended Guanyin, earning great merit. One leapt and splashed through the waves, while the other spewed mist and clouds. Waves and surges darkened the heavens, mist and clouds dimmed the sun and moon. That demon-slaying staff resembled a white tiger emerging from the mountains; this solid iron club was like a yellow dragon lying in wait. One advanced, parting snakes and stirring grass; the other swung wide, scattering hawks and splitting pines. The battle raged until darkness enveloped everything, stars shone brightly, and mist swirled, blurring heaven and earth. That one had long dwelled in the Weak Water, fierce and relentless; this one achieved his first great feat since leaving Spirit Mountain.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two fought back and forth for dozens of rounds, evenly matched, with no clear victor. Finally, the monster blocked Mu Zha's iron club and demanded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, to dare confront me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am Mu Zha, the Second Prince of the Heavenly King Tota, known as Huai'an the Pilgrim. I now accompany my master on a journey to the Eastern Lands to seek the pilgrim who will retrieve the scriptures. Who are you, demon, to boldly block our path?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster suddenly realized, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I remember you practicing alongside Guanyin of the South Sea in the Bamboo Grove! Why have you come here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Mu Zha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that Master standing on the shore?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHearing this, the monster stammered repeatedly, lowered his magical staff, and allowed Mu Zha to lead him before Guanyin. Prostrating himself, he pleaded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive my sins and listen to my confession. I am no evil spirit—I am the Scroll-Raising General, an attendant to the imperial carriage in the Celestial Palace.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I accidentally broke a glass cup during the cricket peach banquet that the Jade Emperor punished me with eight hundred lashes and banished me to the mortal realm, transforming me into this wretched form. Moreover, every seven days, he commands flying swords to pierce my chest and sides more than a hundred times before withdrawing. Thus, I suffer such torment. With no other choice, driven by unbearable hunger and cold, every two or three days I venture out into the waves to seek passersby for sustenance. Little did I expect today, through ignorance, to have offended the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You were guilty in Heaven, and now that you've been cast down, you continue to harm living beings—truly, sin upon sin. I have received Buddha's decree to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. Why don't you join my path, embrace virtuous fruit, become a disciple of that pilgrim, and accompany him westward to pay homage to the Buddha and obtain the sacred texts? Then I shall ensure the flying swords no longer pierce you. Once your mission is accomplished, you'll be absolved of guilt and restored to your original position. What say you?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am willing to embrace the righteous path.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Stepping forward, he said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, I have devoured countless humans here, and several pilgrims have passed by, all of whom I've consumed. Every time I ate someone, I tossed their head into the quicksand, where it sank straight to the bottom (a water so deep even goose feathers cannot float). Yet nine pilgrims' skulls floated on the surface, refusing to sink. Thinking them strange objects, I strung them together with a rope and kept them for amusement during idle moments. But now, if the pilgrims never reach this place, wouldn't that only hinder my own future prospects?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How could they possibly fail to arrive? You may hang those skulls above your head as a reminder, waiting patiently for the pilgrims; they will surely prove useful.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If that's the case, I gladly accept your guidance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred the precepts upon him, designated sand as his surname, and thus he became known as Sha Wujing. From that moment, he entered the monastic order, helped the Bodhisattva cross the river, purified his heart and mind, resolved never again to harm living beings, and dedicated himself solely to awaiting the pilgrim.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter bidding farewell to the monster, the Bodhisattva and Muzha set off directly toward the Eastern lands. After traveling for some time, they came upon another towering mountain shrouded in malevolent energy, making it impossible to climb. Just as they prepared to ride the clouds over the mountain, a sudden gust of wind arose, and another demon appeared. This demon was truly fearsome:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHis lips curled upward like lotus petals, his ears resembled giant fans, and his golden eyes gleamed fiercely. His tusks were sharp as steel files, and his gaping mouth seemed like a blazing brazier. A golden helmet tightly secured his cheeks, and armored scales adorned his body like a retreating python. In one hand, he wielded a spiked club resembling a dragon's claw, while a crescent-shaped bow hung from his waist, its ten arrows gleaming brightly. His imposing presence intimidated even the fiercest spirits, and his soaring ambition dwarfed the might of celestial gods. Without hesitation, he charged forward, aiming his spiked club at the Bodhisattva. But Muzha stepped in to block the attack, shouting loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You vile monster, how dare you behave so rudely! Take this!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The demon retorted, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This monk doesn't know when to die! Here's my pitchfork!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" And so, beneath the mountain, the two clashed fiercely, battling to decide the victor. It was a truly fierce fight:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe demon was ferocious, yet Hui'an possessed great power. Iron clubs split hearts, and spiked drills met faces head-on. Dust and dirt filled the air, darkening heaven and earth, while flying rocks and debris startled ghosts and gods. The nine-pronged pitchfork gleamed brilliantly, its double rings ringing clearly; the iron staff was sleek and black, soaring through both hands. One was the prince of the Heavenly King, the other a valiant general spirit. One protected the law on Mount Putuo, the other dwelled as a demon in a cave. In this encounter, neither knew who would lose nor who would win.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the two were locked in battle, Guanyin appeared in mid-air, tossing down a lotus flower to separate the pitchfork and staff. Startled, the monster asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who are you, monk, daring to play tricks like 'flowers before my eyes' to deceive me?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You mere mortal with fleshly eyes! I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. This lotus flower was thrown by my master—you can't even recognize it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Bodhisattva of the South Sea—is that Guanyin, who sweeps away three calamities and rescues from eight tribulations?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Muzha answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Who else could it be?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster dropped his spiked club, bowed deeply, and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother, where is the Bodhisattva? Please trouble yourself to introduce me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMuzha pointed upward and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't it right there?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster bowed repeatedly toward the sky, crying out loudly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bodhisattva, forgive me! Forgive me!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGuanyin descended from the clouds and approached, asking, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What kind of wild boar transformed into a spirit are you, what sort of old pig wreaks havoc here, daring to block my way?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The monster replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am neither a wild boar nor an old pig—I was originally Tianpeng, the Marshal of the Heavenly River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It was only because I teased Chang'e while drunk that the Jade Emperor struck me with two thousand hammer blows and banished me to the mortal realm. My true spirit, in a misguided attempt at rebirth, mistakenly entered the womb of a sow, resulting in this monstrous form. I bit and killed the sow, slaughtered the entire herd of pigs, and seized this mountain territory, surviving by preying on humans. Unexpectedly, I’ve encountered you, Bodhisattva—please, I beg you, save me! Tassa asked, “What is the name of this mountain?” The monster replied, “It’s called Mount Fuleng. Within the mountain lies a cave known as Yunzhan Cave. Originally, there lived a woman named Egg Sister Two inside that cave. Seeing that I had some martial skills, she made me the head of the household and even nicknamed me ‘Inverted Gate.’ But less than a year later, she died, leaving all her possessions to me. Now, after living here for so long, I have no meaningful occupation.” The Bodhisattva said, “As the ancients taught: ‘If you wish for a future, avoid actions that lead to none.’ You broke the laws of Heaven above, yet still refuse to abandon your violent nature, harming living beings and creating karma. Isn’t that committing two offenses at once?” The monster retorted, “A future? A future! If I followed your advice, I’d be left to starve! As the saying goes: ‘Obeying official law means being beaten to death; obeying Buddhist law means starving to death.’ Go away! Go away! It’s better to catch a traveler and feast on his fatty flesh! Who cares about two sins, three sins, a thousand sins, ten thousand sins!” The Bodhisattva replied, “‘Heaven responds to sincere human wishes.’ If you’re willing to turn to the righteous path, there will surely be a place for you to sustain yourself. The world has five grains; they can all satisfy hunger—why must you survive by eating people?” Upon hearing this, the monster seemed to awaken from a dream and said to the Bodhisattva, “I want to follow the right path, but how can I when ‘to offend Heaven leaves no prayer unanswered’?” The Bodhisattva continued, “I’ve received Buddha’s command to journey eastward in search of the pilgrim who seeks scriptures. You could become his disciple and accompany him on a journey westward, redeeming your sins through merit, and I’ll ensure you escape this calamity.” The monster eagerly agreed, exclaiming, “I’m willing! I’m willing!” The Bodhisattva then touched his head, conferred upon him the precepts, assigned him the surname Zhu (Pig), gave him the Dharma name Zhu Wuneng, and instructed him to observe vegetarian vows, renouncing the five pungent vegetables and the three forbidden meats, patiently awaiting the arrival of the pilgrim. After parting ways with Mutza, the Bodhisattva and Mutza rose into the clouds, traveling onward, when suddenly they saw a jade dragon crying out in mid-air. Approaching it, the Bodhisattva asked, “Who are you, dragon, and why are you suffering here?” The dragon replied, “I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I set fire to the luminous pearl in the palace, my father reported me to Heaven, accusing me of rebellion. The Five Emperors hung me in mid-air and beat me three hundred times, and soon I’ll be executed. Please, Bodhisattva, save me!” Hearing this, Guanyin immediately rushed with Mutza toward the Southern Heavenly Gate. There, the two celestial masters, Qiu and Zhang, greeted them and asked, “Where are you headed?” The Bodhisattva replied, “This humble monk wishes to see the Jade Emperor.” The two masters quickly reported the request, and the Jade Emperor descended from his throne to welcome them. After paying respects, the Bodhisattva said, “I’ve been sent by Buddha to seek the pilgrim in the Eastern Lands. On my way, I encountered a wicked dragon hanging here, and I’ve come specifically to petition for mercy, asking that his life be spared and entrusted to me, so he may serve as a mount for the pilgrim.” Upon hearing this, the Five Emperors immediately issued an edict of pardon, ordering a heavenly general to release the dragon and deliver him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva expressed gratitude and departed. The little dragon prostrated himself, thanking the Bodhisattva for saving his life, and pledged obedience to her commands. The Bodhisattva placed him deep in a ravine, where he would wait for the pilgrim to arrive, transforming into a white horse and earning merit in the West. The little dragon accepted the order and quietly disappeared. Leading Mutza, the Bodhisattva continued her journey across this mountain and onward toward the Eastern Lands. Not long after, they suddenly saw countless golden rays of light and auspicious vapors rising in thousands of streams. Mutza exclaimed, “Master, that shining place must be the Five Elements Mountain, where the Buddha’s ‘seal’ is affixed!” The Bodhisattva confirmed, “Indeed, that’s the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, who once disrupted the Peach Banquet and caused chaos in the Heavenly Palace—he now lies imprisoned beneath this seal.” Mutza agreed, “Exactly, exactly!” Master and disciple climbed the mountain together and gazed upon the inscription, which read the six-syllable mantra: “Om Mani Padme Hum.” After examining it, the Bodhisattva sighed deeply and composed a poem, which reads:  \\\\\\\\nHow pitiful that the mischievous monkey defied authority,  \\\\\\\\nOnce reckless and bold, flaunting heroic might.  \\\\\\\\nDeceitful, he disrupted the Peach Banquet,  \\\\\\\\nDaringly intruded upon the Tuishou Palace.  \\\\\\\\nUnrivaled among ten thousand soldiers,  \\\\\\\\nHis might resounded through the nine heavens.  \\\\\\\\nNow trapped by our Buddha Shakyamuni,  \\\\\\\\nWhen will he stretch forth again and display his glory?  \\\\\\\\nWhile master and disciple were speaking, the Great Sage was already alerted.Da Sheng stood at the foot of the mountain and shouted loudly,  \\\\\\\\n“Who is it up there on the hill, reciting poetry and exposing my flaws?”  \\\\\\\\nUpon hearing this, the Bodhisattva immediately descended the mountain to investigate. Below the rocky cliff, they found the local deity, the mountain god, and the celestial generals who had been guarding the Great Sage—all coming forward to greet the Bodhisattva and escort them before the Great Sage himself. When they looked closely, they saw that he was trapped inside a stone casket, able to speak but unable to move. The Bodhisattva asked, “Hey you with the surname Sun, do you recognize me?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage opened his fiery golden eyes, nodded vigorously, and cried out, “How could I not know you? You are indeed the compassionate and merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva of Mount Putuo in the South Sea, who saves those in distress and hardship. Thank you for your kindness! Thank you for your kindness! I’ve been spending each day here like an eternity, with not a single acquaintance to visit me. But pray tell, where have you come from?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “I was sent by the Buddha’s decree to journey eastward in search of someone to retrieve scriptures. Passing by here, I paused briefly to check on you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage said, “The Buddha deceived me, trapping me beneath this mountain for over five hundred years, unable to break free. I earnestly beg you, great Bodhisattva, to show me some mercy and rescue old Sun once and for all!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva responded, “Your sins run deep. If I were to free you now, I fear you’d only cause more trouble—such an outcome would hardly be commendable.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage insisted, “I’ve already repented deeply. Please, great compassionate one, point me toward a path of redemption, and I’ll willingly devote myself to cultivation.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so it came to pass:  \\\\\\\\n“A single thought arises in the human heart, and heaven and earth take note. If good and evil remain unpunished, surely heaven and earth must harbor bias.”  \\\\\\\\nHearing these words, the Bodhisattva felt immense joy and said to the Great Sage, “As the scriptures say: ‘Speak kindly, and distant lands will respond; speak unkindly, and distant lands will recoil.’ Since you’ve shown such sincerity, when I reach the Tang Empire in the East, I’ll find someone tasked with retrieving scriptures and instruct him to rescue you. You can become his disciple, uphold the teachings, and enter the Buddhist fold. Then we can work together toward enlightenment. What do you say?”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage exclaimed loudly, “I accept! I accept!”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva continued, “Since you’ve shown such virtue, let me give you a Dharma name.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Great Sage replied, “I already have a name—I’m called Sun Wukong.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva happily added, “Two others have previously taken refuge under the character ‘Wu’—you too shall bear that character, perfectly aligning with them. How wonderful, how wonderful! There’s no need for further reminders; I shall depart now.”  \\\\\\\\nThus, the Great Sage, having realized his true nature, returned wholeheartedly to Buddhism, while the Bodhisattva lingered, mindful of her divine mission.  \\\\\\\\nTogether with Mutzha, they set off eastward, arriving without delay in Chang’an, the capital of the Tang Empire. As mist cleared and clouds dispersed, master and disciple transformed into two ragged, leprous monks, entering the city of Chang’an unnoticed, unaware that evening had already fallen. Walking along the main market street, they spotted a local deity shrine and stepped right inside, startling the local deity and sending the ghostly soldiers into trembling fear. Realizing it was the Bodhisattva, the deity quickly prostrated himself in reverence. Hastily, the local deity ran to inform the City God, the district magistrate, and all the deities of every temple throughout Chang’an, who promptly gathered to pay their respects, saying, “Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our tardiness in welcoming you.”  \\\\\\\\nThe Bodhisattva replied, “You must not reveal this news. I’ve come here specifically by the Buddha’s command to seek out someone who will retrieve scriptures. I’ll temporarily stay in your temple for a few days, until I find the true monk, then I’ll return.”  \\\\\\\\nAll the deities returned to their respective posts, and the local deity was hurriedly relocated to the City God’s temple for temporary residence, while the master and disciple concealed their true forms.  \\\\\\\\nFor now, we don’t yet know whether they’ll succeed in finding the scripture seeker. Tune in next time to find out.  \\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Appendix: Chen Guangrui Sets Off for Office and Encounters Disaster; Jiangliu Monk Takes Revenge to Restore His Roots.  \\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of Chang’an, the great capital of Shaanxi Province, a city built as the imperial seat by emperors of past dynasties. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han eras, the three districts have blossomed like brocade, and eight rivers flow around the city, truly making it a land of scenic wonders. At this time, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Zhenguan, and had already reigned for thirteen years, in the year of Ji Si. The realm enjoyed peace, tribute flowed in from all directions, and the four seas acknowledged his sovereignty. One day, Emperor Taizong convened all civil and military officials, and after the morning ceremony concluded, Prime Minister Wei Zheng stepped forward and reported, “Today the realm is peaceful, and tranquility prevails in all directions. In accordance with ancient custom, we should open examination halls, recruit talented individuals, and promote capable people to serve in governance.”  \\\\\\\\nEmperor Taizong said,  \\\\\\\\n“What you propose, esteemed minister, is entirely reasonable.”  \\\\\\\\nAnd so he issued a notice calling for talented scholars, proclaiming throughout the empire: all prefectures, provinces, and counties, regardless of whether they were military or civilian, anyone among the literati who possessed clear understanding of classical texts and excelled in the three examinations, should travel to Chang’an to take the test.When the imperial edict reached the region of Haizhou, a man named Chen Guangrui, with the courtesy name E, saw it and immediately returned home. He said to his mother, Lady Zhang, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The court has issued a yellow proclamation, calling for talented individuals from southern provinces to take the examinations. I intend to go and compete. If I can secure even a minor official post, it will bring honor and fame to my family, ensure prosperity for my wife and children, and bring glory to our household—this is my greatest ambition. I am informing you of my decision before I depart.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My son, as a scholar, you should indeed 'study in youth and act in adulthood.' That is exactly how it should be. But when you go to take the exams, you must be careful along the way, and once you obtain an official position, return home promptly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui then instructed his servants to pack his belongings, bid farewell to his mother, and set off on his journey without delay. Upon arriving in Chang'an, he found that the examination grounds were already open, so he entered the competition. After passing the preliminary tests and successfully completing the three policy essays in the imperial court examination, Emperor Tang personally bestowed upon him the title of zhuangyuan (top scholar) and awarded him a horse to ride through the streets for three days. Unexpectedly, during his parade, he passed by the residence of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, whose only daughter, Wen Jiao, also known as Mantang Jiao, had not yet married. She was standing atop a beautifully decorated pavilion, tossing a silk ball to select her husband. As Chen Guangrui happened to pass below, the young lady caught sight of his outstanding appearance and recognized him as the newly crowned zhuangyuan. Overjoyed, she threw down the silk ball, which landed squarely on Guangrui's black official cap. Suddenly, a gentle melody of flutes and strings filled the air, and more than ten maids descended from the pavilion, leading Guangrui's horse and escorting him into the prime minister's mansion to celebrate their wedding. The prime minister and his wife immediately came out to greet the guests, officiated the ceremony, and formally betrothed the young lady to Guangrui. They bowed to heaven and earth, exchanged vows as husband and wife, and paid respects to the bride's parents. The prime minister then ordered a banquet to be prepared, and they celebrated joyfully throughout the night.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two held hands tenderly as they entered the bridal chamber. The next morning, at the third watch of the day, Emperor Taizong took his seat in the Golden Hall, surrounded by civil and military officials who had gathered for court. Taizong asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What official position should be granted to the newly appointed zhuangyuan, Chen Guangrui?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Prime Minister Wei Zheng replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your servant has examined the available vacancies in various prefectures and counties and found that Jiangzhou currently has an unoccupied post. I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint him to this position.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Taizong immediately agreed and appointed Guangrui as governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to prepare for departure without delay. Guangrui expressed his gratitude, left the palace, returned to the prime minister's residence, discussed the matter with his wife, bid farewell to his in-laws, and set off with his wife toward Jiangzhou to assume his new post.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they left Chang'an, the weather was late spring, with gentle breezes turning the willows green and fine rain sprinkling red blossoms. Upon arriving home, Guangrui and his wife paid their respects to Lady Zhang. Lady Zhang said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Congratulations, my son! You've not only succeeded in the examinations but have also brought your bride home.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It is entirely due to your blessings, Mother, that I was fortunate enough to become zhuangyuan, received the imperial procession through the streets, and encountered the silk ball toss in front of Prime Minister Yin's residence, where I was chosen as his daughter's husband. Now the court has appointed me governor of Jiangzhou, and I have come to fetch you so we may all travel together to take up my post.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang was overjoyed and began preparing for the journey. After several days on the road, they arrived at Liu Xiao'er's inn near Wanhuadian. Suddenly, Lady Zhang fell ill, and she said to Guangrui, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm feeling unwell. Let's rest here for two days to recover before continuing.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui obeyed her wishes. The following morning, he noticed a man selling a golden carp outside the inn. Guangrui bought it for one guan, intending to cook it for his mother. But as he looked closer, he saw that the fish blinked its eyes mysteriously. Astonished, Guangrui exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've heard that fish and snakes blink their eyes—it surely can't be an ordinary creature!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He then asked the fisherman, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Where did you catch this fish?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Fifteen li from the city, in the Hongjiang River.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui immediately released the fish back into the river. Returning to the inn, he told his mother about it, and she said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Releasing living creatures is a virtuous deed, and I'm very pleased.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui added, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We've already stayed here for three days, and time is pressing. I plan to leave tomorrow, but I wonder if you're well enough to travel?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Zhang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not feeling well, and the heat along the road might worsen my condition. Why don't you rent a house here temporarily while I stay behind? Leave some money with me, and you two can go ahead to take up your post. I'll join you when the autumn coolness arrives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui consulted with his wife, rented a house, gave his mother some funds, and bid them both farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe journey was arduous, with days of travel and nights spent in lodging, and soon they reached the Hongjiang ferry crossing. There, they found Liu Hong and Li Biao waiting to guide them across the river. It seemed that Guangrui's past karma had destined him to encounter these ill-fated individuals.Guangrui ordered his servant to carry their luggage aboard the boat. As husband and wife were about to board together, Liu Hong opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin: her face was as bright as the full moon, her eyes like autumn waters, her lips cherry-red, and her waist slender as a willow branch—indeed possessing beauty enough to make fish sink and wild geese fall from the sky, a countenance so dazzling it could shame the moon and blush flowers. Instantly consumed by wolfish intent, he conspired with Li Biao, steering the boat to an uninhabited stretch of water. When midnight struck, they first killed the servant, then beat Guangrui to death, dumping both bodies into the river. Seeing her husband slain, the young lady prepared to throw herself into the water as well. But Liu Hong grabbed her tightly, saying, “If you yield to me, all will be forgiven! If not, I’ll cut you down right here!” With no other choice, the lady reluctantly agreed, submitting to Liu Hong for the time being. The villain then rowed the boat to the southern shore, handing it over to Li Biao to manage, while he himself donned Guangrui’s attire and official credentials, taking the lady with him to assume his post in Jiangzhou.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the body of the murdered servant drifted downstream with the current, but Guangrui’s corpse sank to the bottom and remained motionless. A sea demon patrolling near the mouth of the Hong River happened to notice it and immediately reported to the Dragon King’s palace. At that very moment, the Dragon King was presiding over court when the demon reported: “Today, near the mouth of the Hong River, someone unknown has beaten to death a scholar and left his body at the bottom of the water.” The Dragon King ordered the body to be brought forth and examined closely. Upon inspection, he declared, “This man is none other than my savior! How could he have been murdered? As the saying goes, one repays kindness with kindness. Today, I must save his life to repay the favor he once showed me.” He immediately penned an official decree and dispatched the demon straight to the City God and Land Deity of Hongzhou, instructing them to retrieve the scholar’s soul and restore his life.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe City God and Land Deity summoned a little ghost to deliver Chen Guangrui’s soul to the demon, who carried it to the Crystal Palace and presented it to the Dragon King. The Dragon King asked, “Young scholar, what is your name and family name? Where are you from? Why did you come here, only to be murdered?” Guangrui bowed respectfully and replied, “I am Chen E, courtesy name Guangrui, from Hongnong County, Haizhou. I was fortunate enough to become the top scholar in the recent imperial examinations and appointed governor of Jiangzhou. On my way to take up my post with my wife, we boarded a boat by the riverbank, only to be betrayed by the villain Liu Hong, who coveted my wife and murdered me, casting my body into the water. Great King, please save me!” Hearing this, the Dragon King said, “So it is! Sir, the golden carp you released earlier was none other than myself. You saved my life, and now that you’re in trouble, how could I possibly refuse to help?” He then had Guangrui’s body placed aside, inserting a magical bead into his mouth to preserve it intact, so that one day it could regain its spirit and seek vengeance. He added, “For now, your true soul shall temporarily serve as a chief official in my underwater realm.” Guangrui bowed deeply in gratitude, and the Dragon King hosted a banquet in his honor, which need not be detailed further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin loathed Liu the villain with every fiber of her being, wishing she could devour his flesh and flay his skin—but pregnant as she was, unsure whether the child was a boy or girl, she had no choice but to endure and comply for the time being. Before she knew it, they had arrived in Jiangzhou. Officials, clerks, and servants all came out to greet them. Local dignitaries arranged a grand banquet in the courthouse to celebrate. Liu Hong said, “My arrival here today is entirely due to your generous support.” The officials replied, “Your Excellency is highly talented and virtuous; naturally, you treat the people as your own children, keeping lawsuits simple and punishments light. We, your subordinates, are fortunate indeed—why be so modest?” After the banquet concluded, everyone dispersed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTime passed swiftly. One day, Liu Hong had urgent business far away, leaving the lady alone in the official residence, longing for her mother-in-law and husband. Sitting in the flower pavilion, she sighed deeply, suddenly feeling weary, with pain in her abdomen, and fainting to the ground. Unbeknownst to her, she gave birth to a son. Suddenly, a voice whispered in her ear: “Beloved daughter-in-law, heed my words carefully. I am the Star Lord of the South Pole, sent by Guanyin Bodhisattva’s command specifically to entrust this child to you. In the future, he will achieve great fame and distinction, far beyond the ordinary. When Liu the villain returns, he will surely harm this child, so you must protect him diligently. Your husband has already been rescued by the Dragon King; someday, husband and wife will reunite, mother and son will be reunited, and justice will finally be served. Remember my words well—wake up, wake up!” Having spoken these words, the voice vanished. The lady awoke, recalling every word clearly, clutching her child tightly, yet feeling utterly helpless. Suddenly, Liu Hong returned and, upon seeing the child, immediately tried to drown him. The lady quickly said, “It’s already late today; let’s wait until tomorrow to throw him into the river.” Fortunately, early the next morning, Liu Hong received urgent orders to leave on another distant errand. Secretly, the lady thought, “If we wait until the villain returns, this child’s life will be lost! Better to abandon him in the river now and let fate decide his destiny.”\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If Heaven takes pity on us and someone rescues this child, raising him as their own, perhaps we shall meet again someday.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But fearing it might be difficult to recognize him later, she bit her finger until it bled, writing a blood letter detailing her parents' names, origins, and the full story of their plight. She then bit off the little toe from the child's left foot, using it as a distinctive mark. Taking a close-fitting undershirt, she wrapped the baby in it and, seizing an opportune moment, carried him out of the official residence. Fortunately, the government office was not far from the river, so the young lady hurried to the riverside and burst into tears. Just as she was about to abandon the child, she suddenly noticed a wooden plank drifting lazily along the riverbank. Bowing toward the heavens in prayer, she carefully placed the baby onto the plank, secured him with a strap, tied the blood letter to his chest, and gently pushed the makeshift raft into the river, letting fate guide its course. With tears streaming down her face, she returned to the residence without further ado.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the child floated downstream on the wooden plank, drifting steadily until he came to rest at the foot of Jinshan Temple. The abbot of Jinshan Temple was a venerable monk named Faming, who had attained profound enlightenment through spiritual cultivation and mastered the subtle secrets of immortality. While meditating in deep contemplation, he suddenly heard the cries of a baby. His heart stirred, and he hurried to the riverside, where he saw a tiny infant sleeping peacefully on a piece of driftwood. Hastily, he rescued the child and, upon examining the blood letter clutched in the baby's hand, learned of his origins. He gave the child a nickname, Jiangliu, entrusted him to others for care, and carefully preserved the blood letter as a precious keepsake. Time flew by like an arrow, days and months passing swiftly, and before anyone realized it, Jiangliu had grown into an eighteen-year-old youth. The abbot then called him forward, shaved his head, and ordained him as a monk, giving him the Dharma name Xuanzang. After receiving the precepts and having his head touched, Xuanzang resolved firmly to pursue the path of enlightenment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne day, during the late spring season, everyone gathered beneath the shade of pine trees to listen to sutras, engage in meditation, and discuss profound teachings. At that very moment, a dissolute monk who indulged in meat and wine found himself utterly confounded by Xuanzang. Enraged, the monk lashed out, shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You wretched creature! You don't even know your own name or your parents—what right do you have to meddle here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Hearing such harsh words, Xuanzang knelt before his master in the temple, tears streaming down his face, and pleaded earnestly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"All beings are born between heaven and earth, nourished by yin and yang and sustained by the five elements. It is only natural that one is born of a father and raised by a mother. How can there be a person in this world without parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" He continued to implore his master repeatedly, begging to learn the names of his parents. The abbot finally said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you truly wish to find your parents, come with me to my quarters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang followed him to the abbot's chamber, where the elder climbed up to the rafters, retrieved a small box, and opened it to reveal the blood letter and the undershirt, handing them over to Xuanzang. As Xuanzang unfolded the blood letter and read it carefully, he finally learned the full details of his parents' names and the tragic circumstances surrounding their wrongful deaths. Upon finishing the reading, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How can I call myself human if I cannot avenge my parents' wrongs? For eighteen years, I've lived without knowing my birth parents, and only today do I discover that I have a mother. Had it not been for my master rescuing and nurturing me, how could I stand here today? Please allow me to go seek out my mother, and afterward, I will carry incense bowls on my head, rebuild the temple, and repay my master's immense kindness!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If you wish to find your mother, take this blood letter and undershirt with you. Simply beg alms as you travel directly to the private residence in Jiangzhou, and there you shall surely meet your mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang accepted his master's instructions, disguised himself as a mendicant monk, and set off straight for Jiangzhou. Coincidentally, Liu Hong happened to be away on business, and fate seemed to bring mother and son together. Xuanzang arrived at the gate of the private residence, chanting sutras and calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Lady Yin, meanwhile, had dreamt the previous night of a waning moon that had fully regained its roundness. She mused to herself, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother-in-law remains missing, my husband was murdered by bandits, and my son was cast into the river. If someone has adopted him, he must now be eighteen years old. Perhaps today, heaven has arranged for us to meet again—it cannot be mere coincidence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" As she pondered these thoughts, she suddenly heard someone chanting sutras outside the residence, calling out, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Alms, please!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Seizing the opportunity, she stepped out and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"From where do you come?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I am a humble monk, a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin exclaimed, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"So you are indeed a disciple of Abbot Faming of Jinshan Temple—\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and invited him inside, offering him a meal. As she observed his demeanor and speech closely, she noticed a striking resemblance to her late husband. She dismissed her maidservants and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Young master, did you become a monk from childhood, or did you enter the monastic life later in life? What is your full name, and do you still have living parents?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I did not become a monk in childhood, nor did I enter the priesthood in middle age. To tell you the truth, my grievances are as vast as the sky, and my hatred runs as deep as the sea! My father was treacherously murdered, and my mother was taken by bandits. My master, Abbot Faming, instructed me to come to the Jiangzhou residence and search for my mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What is your mother's surname?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My mother's surname is Yin, her given name is Wenjiao; my father's surname is Chen, his given name is Guangrui; my childhood nickname was Jiangliu, and my Dharma name is Xuanzang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLady Yin declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wenjiao—that is me! But what proof do you have to support your claim?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Upon hearing that it was his mother, Xuanzang dropped to his knees and burst into tears: “If my mother doesn’t believe me, here’s proof—a blood-written undershirt!” Wenjiao took the undershirt and examined it carefully; sure enough, it was genuine. Mother and son embraced each other, weeping bitterly, and she urged him, “My son, hurry and leave at once!” Xuanzang replied, “For eighteen years I’ve never known my birth parents, and only today have I finally met my mother—how can I bear to part from her?” The young lady said, “My son, you must quickly make your escape! If Liu the bandit returns, he’ll surely take your life! Tomorrow I’ll pretend to fall ill, claiming that years ago I vowed to donate a hundred pairs of monk’s shoes, and I’ll come to your temple to fulfill that vow. At that time, I’ll have something important to tell you.” Xuanzang, following her advice, bowed farewell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, ever since seeing her son, the young lady had been filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry. One day, she suddenly feigned illness, refusing food and drink, and lay down in bed. When Liu Hong returned to the office and asked about the reason, she said, “When I was young, I made a vow to donate one hundred pairs of monk’s shoes. Five days ago, I dreamt of a monk holding a sharp blade, demanding those shoes, and ever since then I’ve felt unwell.” Liu Hong exclaimed, “Why didn’t you mention such a trivial matter earlier?” He immediately ordered Wang Zuo Ya and Li You Ya to convene in court: all households in Jiangzhou city were instructed to prepare one pair of monk’s shoes each, with a deadline of five days for completion. The people dutifully fulfilled the order. Then the young lady turned to Liu Hong and asked, “Now that the monk’s shoes are ready, which temple would be suitable for me to go and fulfill my vow?” Liu Hong replied, “In Jiangzhou there’s Jinshan Temple and Jiaoshan Temple—whichever temple you prefer, you may choose.” The young lady said, “I’ve long heard that Jinshan Temple is an excellent monastery, so I shall go there.” Liu Hong immediately summoned Wang and Li, ordering them to prepare a boat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady brought along her trusted attendants, boarded the boat, and as soon as the oars pushed off, they headed straight for Jinshan Temple.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, back at the temple, Xuanzang reported everything to Elder Faming, who was overjoyed upon hearing the tale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, a maid arrived first, announcing that the lady had come to the temple to fulfill her vow. All the monks came out to greet her.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe young lady walked directly through the temple gates, paid homage to the Bodhisattva, and arranged a grand vegetarian feast. She then instructed her maids to place the monk’s shoes and socks on a tray. When she reached the main hall, she again lit incense and offered prayers, after which she asked Elder Faming to distribute the offerings among the monks. Once the monks had dispersed and the hall was empty, Xuanzang knelt forward. The young lady asked him to remove his shoes and socks, and indeed, a small toe was missing from his left foot. At that moment, the two embraced once more, weeping uncontrollably, and expressed their gratitude to the elder for raising him. Faming said, “Now that mother and son have reunited, there’s a risk that the villain might find out. You must quickly withdraw before disaster strikes.” The young lady added, “My son, I’m giving you this ring as a token. Head northwest toward Hongzhou, a journey of roughly fifteen hundred li. There, in Wanhuadian, you’ll find Granny Zhang, your father’s own mother. I’ve also written you a letter to deliver to the imperial palace in Tang’s capital, to the home of Prime Minister Yin Kaishan, on the left side of the Golden Hall—those are your maternal grandparents. Hand my letter to your grandfather, and ask him to petition the Tang emperor, gather troops, capture this villain, avenge your father, and only then will your mother’s life be saved. I dare not linger here any longer, for fear that the villain might suspect me if I return late.” With that, she left the temple, boarded the boat, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nXuanzang returned to the temple, weeping, and informed his master before bidding farewell immediately, heading straight for Hongzhou. Upon arriving at Wanhuadian, he asked the shopkeeper, Liu Xia’er, “Years ago, a guest named Chen from Jiangzhou stayed at your inn with his mother. How is she doing now?” Liu Xia’er replied, “She did stay at my inn, but later her eyesight failed, and for three or four years she didn’t pay me rent. Now she lives in a dilapidated kiln near the South Gate, begging daily on the streets to survive. That guest left long ago, and since then we’ve had no news of him whatsoever—no one knows why.” Upon hearing this, Xuanzang immediately went to the South Gate and found the old woman living in the broken kiln. The old woman exclaimed, “Your voice sounds just like my son, Chen Guangrui!” Xuanzang replied, “I’m not Chen Guangrui—I’m his son. Miss Wenjiao is my mother.” The old woman asked, “Why haven’t your parents come?” Xuanzang answered, “My father was beaten to death by bandits, and my mother was taken by force as their wife.” The old woman continued, “How did you know to come looking for me?” Xuanzang explained, “My mother sent me to find you. She gave me a letter and a ring.” The old woman took the letter and the ring, bursting into tears as she cried out, “My son came all this way for fame and success—I thought he’d betrayed us and forgotten his kindness, never imagining he’d been murdered!”And I am glad that the emperor has pity on me. After my son, today there are grandchildren looking for me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are your mother-in-law's eyes faint?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I cried so hard that my eyes fainted because I thought about your father all day long and I didn't see him coming.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Xuanzang knelt down and prayed to the Sky: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nian Xuanzang is 18 years old, and his parents' hatred cannot be avenged. Today, I took my mother's order to find my mother-in-law. If the sky shows my disciple's sincerity, I will keep my mother-in-law's eyes clear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" After wishing, he licked the tip of his tongue and his mother-in-law's eyes. In a moment, my eyes lick open and still return to the same place. The mother-in-law looked at the young monk and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You are my grandson! It's just like my son Guang Rui!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The mother-in-law was happy and sad. Xuanzang took her mother-in-law out of the kiln door, went to Liu Xiaoer's shop, and put some money in a house to live with her mother-in-law. Then she entangled herself with her mother-in-law and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'll be back in less than a month.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n Then he quit his mother-in-law and headed for the capital. He found Prime Minister Yin's Mansion on Huangcheng East Street and said to the door, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The little monk is a relative. Come to visit Xianggong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The door was informed of the prime minister, who said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I have no relatives with the monk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The wife said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I dreamed last night that my daughter came home full of charming, unless my son-in-law came back with letters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister then taught the young monk to come to the hall. When the young monk saw the Prime Minister and his wife, he cried and bowed to the ground. He took out a book from his arms and handed it to the prime minister. The Prime Minister opened it, read it from the beginning, and cried bitterly. The lady asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What was the accident?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This Monk is my nephew and yours. Son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by thieves, and Mantang Jiao was forcibly taken as his wife by thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Madame listened and cried bitterly. The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Madam is worried. Come to the court to tell the Lord and personally command the troops. You must avenge your son-in-law.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The next day, the prime minister entered the dynasty and inspired the Tang King to say: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Today, Chen Guangrui, the top scholar of his son-in-law, led his family Xiaojiang to take office. He was killed by Liu Hong, a little water, and took his daughter as his wife. He pretended to be a son-in-law and became an official for many years. This is a change. His Majesty beggars immediately sent troops to eliminate thieves.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" When the King of the Tang Dynasty saw that he was furious, he sent 60,000 Imperial troops to the Prime Minister Yin to supervise the soldiers. The Prime Minister led the decree out of the court, that is, he ordered soldiers to the teaching ground and headed for Jiangzhou. Xiao Xing stayed overnight, the stars fell and the birds flew, but he did not realize he had arrived in Jiangzhou. Prime Minister Yin's soldiers and horses all went down to camp on the north bank. Starry night ordered the gold medal to be called to Jiangzhou Tongzhi and the state sentenced two people. The Prime Minister told him that he knew about the matter and asked him to help him and cross the river together. Before the sky was clear, Liu Hong's Yamen was surrounded. Liu Hong was in a dream when he heard the sound of artillery, the Golden Drums were ringing, and the soldiers killed into the private office. Liu Hong was caught off guard and was captured early. The Prime Minister handed down a military order to tie Liu Hong and his men to the court, and ordered all the troops to camp outside the city. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister went straight into the main hall of the government office and sat down. Please ask the young lady to come out and meet. If the young lady wants to stay and go out, she will hang herself if she is ashamed of her father. Hearing this, Xuanzang hurriedly rescued his mother, knelt down on his knees and said to his mother, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Son and grandfather, unify the troops here and avenge your father. Today, the thief has been captured. Why did my mother want to die? If the mother dies, how can the child survive?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Prime Minister also went to the government to persuade him. The young lady said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I heard that the woman died from one thing. Tongfu has been killed by thieves, how can he be ashamed of being a thief? Because of the posthumous body, had to endure shame to steal life. Today, Xing'er has grown up and seen his old father take revenge for his daughter. What will he see! Only death can repay her husband's ear!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n The Prime Minister said: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This is not my son's change of course with ups and downs. It is all because of a last resort. Why should I be ashamed!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Father and son hugged and cried, and Xuanzang also mourned. The Prime Minister wiped away his tears and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You two should stop worrying. I have captured the enemy thief now, and I will send it off.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That is, I got up and went to the Dharma Field. It happened that Jiangzhou Tongzhi also sent sentinels to take the water thief Li Biao.The prime minister was overjoyed and immediately ordered the soldiers to bring Liu Hong and Li Biao forward. Each was flogged severely with one hundred strokes, after which they confessed under duress, admitting their conspiracy years ago to murder Chen Guangrui. First, Li Biao was nailed onto a wooden donkey, dragged to the marketplace, and executed by being sliced into a thousand pieces, his head then displayed publicly as a warning. Next, Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang ferry crossing, the very spot where he had killed Chen Guangrui years ago. The prime minister, accompanied by the young lady and Xuanzang, personally went to the riverside, offering prayers toward the heavens. They then cruelly gouged out Liu Hong's heart and liver, using them as offerings for Guangrui, and burned a memorial text as part of the ritual.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe three stood by the river weeping bitterly, an act that soon alarmed the underwater realm. A sea patrol Yaksha quickly presented the memorial text to the Dragon King. After reading it, the Dragon King dispatched General Bie Wu to summon Guangrui. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sir,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" said the Dragon King, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"congratulations! Your wife, son, and father-in-law are all at the riverside paying tribute to you. I shall now restore your soul. Moreover, I offer you one如意珠, two walking beads, ten lengths of fine silk, and a beaded jade belt. Today, you shall finally reunite with your wife, child, and mother.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui bowed repeatedly in gratitude. The Dragon King then instructed the Yaksha to carry Guangrui's body out of the river mouth and restore his soul. The Yaksha accepted the order and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Miss Yin had finished mourning her husband and was about to throw herself into the water to end her life, but Xuanzang desperately grabbed hold of her, preventing her from doing so. In the midst of this chaos, suddenly a corpse floated up on the water's surface, drifting close to the riverbank. Miss Yin hurried forward to examine it and recognized her husband's body, bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Everyone gathered around to watch, and they saw Guangrui slowly stretching his fists and legs, his body gradually coming back to life. Suddenly, he sat up, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Guangrui opened his eyes and saw Miss Yin, his father-in-law Prime Minister Yin, and the little monk all weeping beside him. Guangrui asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why are you all here?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Miss Yin replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Because you were murdered by bandits, and later I gave birth to our son. Fortunately, he was raised by the abbot of Jinshan Temple and eventually found me. I sent him to seek out your father, who learned of your fate and petitioned the court. He led troops here, captured the bandits, and just now, they took your heart and liver as offerings to you. I never imagined you would come back to life!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Guangrui explained, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It's all because years ago, when we were at the Wanhuadeng shop, I bought and released that golden carp. Little did I know that carp was actually the Dragon King of these waters. When the villain pushed me into the river, it was thanks to him that I survived. Now he has restored my soul and bestowed upon me these treasures. And I never expected you to give birth to our son, nor that my father-in-law would avenge me. Truly, after enduring so much hardship, sweet happiness has finally arrived—a joy beyond measure!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpon hearing the news, all the officials came to congratulate them. The prime minister ordered a banquet to be prepared, thanking his subordinates before the army began its return journey. Arriving at Wanhuadeng, the prime minister ordered the troops to set up camp. Guangrui, accompanied by Xuanzang, went to Liu's shop to find his mother-in-law. That night, she had a dream: a withered tree blossomed, and magpies chirped incessantly behind her house. She thought, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Could it be my grandson returning?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Before she could finish her thoughts, Guangrui and his son appeared at the door. The little monk pointed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Isn't that my grandmother?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Upon seeing his aged mother, Guangrui immediately knelt down and prostrated himself. Mother and son embraced, weeping bitterly, and recounted everything that had happened. After settling the bill at the inn, they set off for the capital. Upon entering the prime minister's residence, Guangrui, Miss Yin, his mother, and Xuanzang all met the lady of the house. Overjoyed, she ordered her servants to prepare a grand feast in celebration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe prime minister declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Let us call today's banquet the Reunion Feast.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It truly was a joyful family gathering.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next morning, Emperor Tang ascended the throne, and Prime Minister Yin stepped forward to report in detail all that had transpired, recommending Guangrui for high office. The emperor approved the recommendation and immediately appointed Chen E as a scholar, entrusting him with state affairs. Xuanzang resolved to devote himself to Zen meditation and was sent to practice at Hongfu Temple. Later, Miss Yin calmly took her own life, and Xuanzang returned to Jinshan Temple to express gratitude to Abbot Faming. As for what happened afterward, we shall leave that for the next installment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTable of Contents, Chapter Nine: Yuan Shoucheng's Brilliant Calculation, Free from Selfish Intentions; the Old Dragon King's Foolish Scheme Violates Heavenly Law\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPoem:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA great city in the capital, truly worth beholding,\\\\\\\\nEight rivers flow around the four mountains.\\\\\\\\nHow many emperors rose from this place;\\\\\\\\nSince ancient times, the world speaks of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis chapter specifically describes the great city of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, the site where emperors of successive dynasties established their capitals. Since the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, the land has been adorned with colorful flowers, and eight rivers flow around the city. Thirty-six flower-lined alleys and seventy-two music pavilions stand proudly.According to the map of Hua and Yi, the world’s foremost region truly is a land of extraordinary beauty. Now, Emperor Taizong Wen of the Tang Dynasty has ascended the throne, adopting the reign title Longji Zhenguan. It has already been thirteen years since his coronation, and the current year is Ji Si. Not to mention the heroic figures who stand before him, safeguarding the realm and stabilizing the country, nor those outstanding talents who fought bravely to expand its borders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let us speak of two virtuous men living by the Jing River outside Chang’an city: one is a fisherman named Zhang Shao, and the other a woodcutter named Li Ding. Both are scholars who failed the imperial examinations but are literate mountain folk. One day, after selling their firewood in Chang’an and trading the carp from their baskets, they entered an inn together, enjoyed themselves until half-drunk, each carrying a bottle, and slowly strolled back along the banks of the Jing River. Zhang Shao said:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Brother Li, I think those who strive for fame end up sacrificing their bodies for it; those who chase profit lose themselves in pursuit of gain; those who accept titles sleep with tigers by their side; and those who bask in favor carry snakes up their sleeves. When you come down to it, we’re better off enjoying our serene waters and verdant mountains, living freely and carefree, content with simplicity, letting fate guide us.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding replied, “Brother Zhang, you make a valid point. But your beautiful waters aren’t as good as my lush mountains.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nZhang Shao retorted, “Your lush mountains aren’t as fine as my beautiful waters.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo prove his point, he quoted a poem titled “Die Lian Hua”:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“On misty waters stretching ten thousand li, a tiny boat drifts alone, quietly moored beneath a lone awning, the voice of Xi Shi lingers round about. Free from worldly cares, cleansed of greed and fame, I leisurely pluck reeds and smartweeds by the willow-lined shore. A few sand terns delight my eyes, in willow groves and reed bays, my wife and children laugh with joy. After a peaceful sleep, the winds and waves seem playful—no honor, no disgrace, no worries at all.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLi Ding countered, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Die Lian Hua’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In a stretch of cloud-covered woods, pines bloom profusely; silently I listen to the warbling birds, their tongues as skillful as flutes. The red fades, the green grows rich—the spring is warm, yet summer swiftly arrives. Then autumn comes easily, changing everything; golden flowers bloom, perfect for admiring. And soon winter arrives sharp as a finger snap, yet I roam free through all four seasons, unbothered by anyone.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman said, “Your lush mountains can’t compare to my beautiful waters. Let me share a ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to illustrate how much better off we are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“In the fairyland of clouds and water, life is complete; a boat with oars laid across is my home. Fresh scales I slice, green turtles I cook; purple crabs steamed, red shrimp boiled. Green bamboo shoots, water plantain sprouts—water caltrops and lotus roots are even more delightful. Tender lotus roots, aged lotus seeds, tender celery leaves—water chestnuts, water bamboo, and bird’s-eye flowers.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter replied, “Your beautiful waters can’t match my lush mountains. Here’s another ‘Zhe Gu Tian’ poem to show how much better we have it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Towering peaks reach toward the horizon, a thatched hut is my home. Cured chicken, goose, crab, and turtle—wild boar, roe deer, hare, and deer surpass fish and shrimp. Chinese toon leaves, yellow catalpa buds—bamboo shoots and mountain tea are even more splendid. Purple plums, red peaches, ripe apricots and plums, sweet pears, sour jujubes, osmanthus blossoms.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman insisted, “Your lush mountains really can’t compete with my beautiful waters. Here’s another ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A little boat drifts wherever it may, amid countless layers of misty waves, fearless and free. Casting hooks and nets, I catch fresh fish, not greasy or oily, yet delicious beyond compare; old wife and young child gather round for reunion. With plenty of fish, I head to Chang’an market, trade for fine wine, and drink myself into a stupor. My raincoat serves as blanket on the autumn river, snoring peacefully, without a care, unattached to worldly honors or riches.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter retorted, “Brother Zhang, your beautiful waters still can’t match the joy of my mountain life. Here’s a ‘Tian Xian Zi’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“A few thatched huts built beneath the hills, pines, bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids—how lovely they are! Through forests and over ridges, I search for dry firewood, no one scolds me, I sell as I please, more or less depending on the world. With the money earned, I buy wine and drink at will, savoring freedom in earthenware bowls and porcelain cups. Drunken and drowsy, I lie beneath the pines, unburdened, unconcerned, indifferent to rise or fall in this mortal world.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fisherman concluded, “Brother Li, your mountain life can’t match the joy of my riverside business. Here’s a ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“The red smartweed blooms profusely under moonlight, yellow reeds sway wildly in the breeze. The azure sky stretches far, the Chu River flows empty and clear, stirring the reflections of stars in the pond. Big fish swim in schools into the net, small mandarin fish cluster around the hook. Once caught, they taste especially rich when cooked—laughing and joking, I roam the rivers and lakes.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe woodcutter responded, “Brother Zhang, your riverside life still can’t match the joy of my mountain business. Here’s another ‘Xi Jiang Yue’ poem to prove it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Withered leaves and dead vines fill the paths, broken branches and old bamboo cover the hills. Wild vines and dried kudzu twine wildly, I gather them, tie them up, and carry them off. Worm-eaten hollow elm and willow, wind-broken pine and nanmu trees—\\\\\\\\nI collect them, pile them up for winter’s cold, and trade them for wine and money.”The fisherman said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Though your mountain may be comparable, it still can't match the serene elegance of my waters. Here's a poem to prove it: As the tide ebbs, a lone boat drifts away; at night's deep hour, the oarsman's song fades off. Under the crescent moon, my raincoat brings such quiet charm—wakeful gulls startled, yet unable to rise; colorful clouds part in the sky. Lying idly on the reed isle, with nothing to do, I linger until the sun climbs three poles high. Following my heart's desire, I arrange my days as I please; while courtiers shiver waiting for the watchman's call, how could they compare to my carefree spirit?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your waters' tranquil grace cannot rival the deeper serenity of my green mountains, and here's another poem to attest: On autumn paths, I stride forth with axe in hand; in evening coolness, I return bearing my load. Wildflowers tucked into my hair bring even greater wonder—parting clouds, I find my way; waiting for the moon, I knock at the gate. My young son and mountain wife greet me with joyful smiles; on a bed of grass and wooden pillow, I stretch and rest. Steaming pears and cooking millet, I quickly prepare; new brew matures in jars—truly, this deepens my tranquil heart!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The fisherman continued, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"These are merely our trades, our means of sustenance. You lack the joys I find in leisure time, as this poem shows: Leisurely watching white cranes fly across the sky, I moor my boat by the stream and close the green door. Leaning against the cabin, I teach my child to twist fishing lines, and after rowing, spread the nets out with my wife. With calm resolve, I truly sense the waves have stilled; at ease, I naturally feel the breeze grow mild. A green raincoat and bamboo hat I wear at will—far better than donning purple robes in court.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The woodcutter responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yet your leisure time still doesn't match mine, as this poem also proves: Leisurely watching wispy clouds drift by, I sit alone in my thatched hut, closing the bamboo door. Without tasks, I instruct my child to read from scrolls; sometimes, I gather friends to play chess. When joy comes, I lean on my staff and sing along fragrant paths; when inspiration strikes, I carry my zither up to verdant heights. Straw sandals, hemp ropes, coarse cloth for bedding—such contentment far surpasses fine silken robes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Li Ding, we truly can enjoy light verses together without needing drums or golden goblets. Let's exchange a few lines each, and see how well we fishermen and woodcutters converse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Li Ding replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Zhang speaks most wisely; please begin with a verse.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"My boat rests in emerald waters amid misty ripples, my home lies deep in mountains and wild fields. I especially love spring floods over stream bridges, and most cherish morning mists among rocky peaks. Fresh carp from Longmen often graced my pot, dry firewood charred under daily flames. Fishing nets provide various ways to support old age, carrying poles sustain me till the end. In my small boat, I lie back watching geese take flight, along grassy paths slanting, listening to cranes cry out. In the marketplace of words, I hold no stake; in seas of right and wrong, my trace grows faint. By the stream, cloths hang drying like brocade, on stones I sharpen axes sharp as blades. Under autumn moons, I often fish alone; in spring mountains, no one meets me in solitude. When fish abound, I trade them for wine to share with my wife; leftover firewood sells to buy more liquor for my children. Singing and sipping freely, I let loose and roam; long songs and sighs, I yield to winds that toss and turn. Calling brothers and shipmates, I invite fellow travelers; friends and companions gather with rustic folk. Drinking games and fist-clenching contests pass cups repeatedly; card games and wordplay fill the hours with laughter. Cooking shrimp and crabs brings daily delight, stir-frying duck and braising chicken makes every day rich. My simple wife brews tea with playful ease, my mountain wife cooks meals with calm assurance. At dawn, I raise my staff to stir gentle waves, at sunrise, I carry firewood over rushing streams. After rain, I don my raincoat to catch live carp; in wind, I wield my axe to fell dead pines. Hiding from the world, I feign foolishness and dullness, concealing my name and living mute and deaf.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Zhang Shao said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brother Li, I took the liberty of starting first; now it's your turn—please begin a couplet, and I shall follow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A madman of mountains and wilds, pretending madness in wind and moonlight, an old man lingering proudly in rivers and lakes. Free time belongs to those who live carefree lives, free from gossip, rejoicing in peace. On moonlit nights, I sleep soundly in a thatched hut; in dusk, a light bamboo cloak shields my body. Lost in joy, I make friends with pine and plum, gladly pledge with gulls and egrets. No schemes for fame and fortune occupy my mind; no sounds of strife reach my ears. A sip of fragrant homemade wine at any hour, three meals of wild vegetable soup each day. Two bundles of firewood sustain my life, a fishing rod provides my livelihood. I casually call my child to sharpen steel axes, quietly summon my simple lad to mend old cloths. In spring, I love watching willows turn green, when seasons blend, I delight in reeds and rushes. In summer, I escape the heat by tending new bamboo shoots, in June, I cool off picking tender water caltrops. When frost descends, chickens grow plump and ready for slaughter, on Double Ninth Festival, crabs thrive and are cooked just in time. In winter, I still sleep late as the sun rises, through the Nine Cold Days, I stay warm without steaming. Through all eight seasons, I let my nature run free in the mountains; in four seasons, I indulge my heart by the lake. Gathering firewood brings the joy of immortals, fishing bears no mark of worldly ties. Outside my door, wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues; before my boat, green waters ripple smoothly. Content in my humble state, I need not speak of high office; my settled nature surpasses even a city ten miles wide.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“Ten miles of city walls, high defenses and strict orders; three high officials, their status renowned, listening to imperial edicts. To enjoy mountains and waters is truly rare—how grateful we are to Heaven, Earth, and the gods!” As they exchanged verses and linked their poetic lines, they reached the point where their paths diverged and bowed farewell to each other. Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, take care on your journey! Be cautious when climbing the mountain, watch out for tigers. If any danger should arise, tomorrow’s street might see one less old friend!” Upon hearing this, Li Ding flew into a rage: “You lazy scoundrel! True friends share life and death together—how dare you curse me like that? If I meet with harm from a tiger, you’ll surely face the waves and be swept away by the river!” Zhang Shao replied, “I swear I’ll never be tossed about by rivers again.” Li Ding retorted, “Heaven holds unpredictable storms, and fate brings temporary fortune or misfortune. How can you guarantee you’ll remain unscathed?” Zhang Shao said, “Brother Li, though you speak thus, you haven’t grasped the truth; my business, at least, offers some certainty—I’m certain I won’t encounter such trouble.” Li Ding asked, “Your livelihood on the water is extremely dangerous and perilous, shrouded in mystery and obscurity—what certainty can there be?” Zhang Shao replied, “You simply don’t understand. In Chang’an city, on West Gate Street, there’s a fortune-teller who sells divination. Every day I bring him a golden carp, and he secretly passes me a lesson, guiding me by direction, always hitting the mark. Today I went to buy another reading, and he instructed me to cast my net east of Jinghe Bay’s bend and set my line along the western bank—surely I’ll return with a boatload of fish and shrimp. Tomorrow I’ll come into the city, sell my catch, buy wine, and meet up with you again.” With these words, the two parted ways.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs they spoke, someone was lurking in the grass. It turned out that a night demon patrolling the waters of the Jing River had overheard the talk about hitting the mark every time. He quickly rushed back to the Crystal Palace and urgently reported to the Dragon King:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Trouble! Trouble!” The Dragon King asked, “What kind of trouble?” The night demon replied, “While patrolling the riverbank, I heard two fishermen chatting. As they parted, their words were quite alarming. One fisherman said there’s a fortune-teller on West Gate Street in Chang’an city who makes the most accurate predictions. Every day he gives him a carp, and the fortune-teller secretly teaches him how to hit the mark every single time. If his predictions prove true, won’t he end up wiping out all the aquatic creatures? How then can our underwater palace maintain its splendor, and how can we continue leaping through waves and assisting Your Majesty’s power?” The Dragon King was furious and immediately drew his sword, ready to march on Chang’an and destroy this fortune-teller. But just then, dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp ministers and crab officials, shad generals, mandarin fish lieutenants, and carp prime ministers stepped forward and jointly petitioned:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Your Majesty, please calm down. As the saying goes, words heard casually should not be taken at face value. If Your Majesty goes now, clouds will surely gather, rain will surely fall, and the people of Chang’an may be frightened, drawing blame from Heaven. Your Majesty’s presence is mysterious and unpredictable, capable of infinite transformations—but why not simply transform into a scholar and visit Chang’an yourself? If such a person exists, we can deal with him later; but if he doesn’t, wouldn’t it be unjust to harm others unnecessarily?” The Dragon King heeded their advice, laid down his sword, refrained from summoning clouds or rain, stepped ashore, and transformed himself into a scholar dressed in white, truly majestic and imposing, towering above the valleys and reaching toward the sky. His gait was dignified and proper, his conduct precise and upright. His speech followed Confucius and Mencius, his manners reflected the elegance of King Wen of Zhou. He wore a jade-colored robe and a leisurely headscarf with a single character embroidered on it. Setting off, he strode through the clouds and arrived directly on West Gate Street in Chang’an. There he saw a crowd gathered, bustling and noisy, filled with lively discussions: “Those born in the Year of the Dragon clash with those born in the Year of the Tiger. Though the combinations of Yin-Chen-Si-Hai are considered harmonious, what’s feared is the day clashing with the ruler of the year.” Hearing this, the Dragon King realized this must be the fortune-teller’s place. He stepped forward, pushed through the crowd, and peered inside. What he saw was a room adorned with pearls and jewels on all four walls, rich brocade and silk filling the hall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fragrance of precious incense never ceased, and the porcelain bottles held crystal-clear water. On either side hung paintings by Wang Wei, while above the seat hung an image of Guiguzi.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Duanxi inkstone, golden smoke ink, matched perfectly with a brush of frosty bristles; the Fire Pearl Forest and Guo Pu’s numerology stood beside the newly revised court texts. Six Lines mastered thoroughly, Eight Trigrams understood perfectly. Able to know heaven and earth, skilled at discerning spirits and gods. A compass arranged noon and midnight precisely, a belly full of stars clearly arrayed. Indeed, future events and past matters were as clear as moonlit mirrors; which families prospered and which declined, judged as clearly as divine insight. Foreseeing misfortune and determining good fortune, pronouncing death and proclaiming life. Speaking swiftly as wind and rain, writing so that ghosts and gods trembled. The sign read: “Divine Lessons, Master Yuan Shoucheng.” Who was this man? He turned out to be none other than Yuan Shoucheng, uncle of Yuan Tiangang, the current Imperial Astronomer and Chief of the Bureau of Astronomy.Indeed, the gentleman had an extraordinary appearance, graceful demeanor, and his fame spread throughout the land; his skills were unrivaled in Chang'an. The Dragon King entered and met with the gentleman. After exchanging formal greetings, he invited the Dragon to take a seat, and a young attendant presented tea. The gentleman then asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What brings you here today?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I've come to consult you about the weather forecast for tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman immediately drew a divination chart from his sleeve and declared, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Clouds obscure the mountaintops, mist veils the treetops. If you're asking about rain, it will surely fall tomorrow.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King pressed further, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"At what exact time will it rain tomorrow? And how much rainfall can we expect?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman answered, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tomorrow at Chen hour clouds will gather, at Si hour thunder will roll, at Wu hour rain will begin, and by Wei hour the rain will be sufficient, totaling three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"This cannot be taken lightly! If it truly rains tomorrow according to your predicted timing and amount, I'll reward you with fifty taels of gold as a token of gratitude. But if it doesn't rain, or if the timing or amount is even slightly off, let me tell you plainly—I'll smash your facade, tear down your signboard, and drive you out of Chang'an immediately, never again allowed to deceive the people!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The gentleman cheerfully responded, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Very well, I accept your challenge. Please rest assured, the rain will certainly arrive tomorrow as predicted.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Dragon King took his leave, departed Chang'an, and returned to the Water Palace. The lesser water deities greeted him and asked, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"How was your visit to that fortune-teller?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Oh yes, indeed! What a smooth-talking fellow! I asked him when it would rain, and he confidently predicted tomorrow's rain. When I pressed him for specific times and amounts, he said clouds would form at Chen hour, thunder would strike at Si hour, rain would start at Wu hour, and by Wei hour the rainfall would reach three feet, three inches, and forty-eight points. So I made a wager with him: if his prediction comes true, I'll give him fifty taels of gold as a reward; but if there's even the slightest discrepancy, I'll destroy his facade, kick him out, and forbid him from ever deceiving people in Chang'an again!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The aquatic creatures all laughed and said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty is the Grand Master of the Eight Rivers, the Great Dragon God in charge of rain—only you know whether it will rain or not. How dare he speak such nonsense? That fortune-teller is sure to lose! He's bound to lose!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust as the dragon princes, grandsons, and fish, carp, and crabs were still laughing and discussing this matter, they suddenly heard a voice echoing from mid-air: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial decree!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Everyone looked up and saw a golden-clad warrior holding an imperial edict from the Jade Emperor, heading straight toward the Water Palace. Startled, the Dragon King quickly straightened his robes, lit incense, and respectfully received the decree.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the golden-clad warrior returned to the heavens, the Dragon King expressed his gratitude, opened the sealed document, and read aloud: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Imperial Edict to the General of the Eight Rivers, commanding thunder and lightning; tomorrow you shall bestow rain to benefit the city of Chang'an.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The edict precisely matched the timing and rainfall amounts predicted by the gentleman, leaving the Dragon King utterly shaken and terrified. After regaining his composure, he addressed the aquatic beings: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"There truly are such spiritual individuals in this world! He truly possesses the ability to communicate with heaven and earth—there's no disputing it!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe strategist Shiji reported, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Your Majesty, rest assured. What difficulty could there be in defeating him? I have a small plan that will silence that fellow once and for all.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King asked for details, and the strategist replied, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If we alter the timing of the rain slightly and reduce the amount just a bit, his predictions will clearly be inaccurate. Won't that be enough to prove him wrong? Then we can tear down his signboard, chase him away, and there'll be no trouble at all!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The Dragon King approved the strategy without hesitation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next day, he summoned Feng Bo, Lei Gong, Yun Tong, and Dian Mu, and ascended into the nine heavens above Chang'an. At the appointed time, clouds began to form at Si hour, thunder rumbled at Wu hour, rain fell at Wei hour, and finally ceased at Shen hour—but the total rainfall amounted to only three feet and forty points, one hour earlier than predicted and three inches and eight points less than promised. After issuing orders for his generals to withdraw, he transformed himself back into the guise of a refined scholar dressed in white and headed straight for Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling shop on West Gate Street. Without a word, he smashed the shop's signboard, brush, inkstone, and everything else. Meanwhile, the gentleman calmly sat in his chair, completely unfazed. The Dragon King then picked up a door panel and began striking and shouting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"You deceitful charlatan who spreads false prophecies and misleads the masses! Your divinations are useless, your words absurd! Today's predicted timing and rainfall don't match reality, yet you still sit there boldly. Leave now, or I'll spare your life no longer!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Yet Shoucheng remained utterly fearless, raising his head to the sky and coldly laughing, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've committed no crime, but you, on the other hand, very much have! You may fool others, but you can't fool me. I know exactly who you are—you're not a scholar at all, but the Dragon King of the Jing River. You violated the Jade Emperor's decree by altering the timing and reducing the rainfall, thus breaking heavenly law!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"“You’re standing on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, where a fatal blow is inevitable—yet you still dare to scold me here?” Upon hearing this, the Dragon King was seized with fear, his hair standing on end. Hastily dropping the door panel, he straightened his clothes, bowed deeply, and knelt before the master, saying, “Please don’t take offense, Master. Those earlier words were merely spoken in jest; who could have foreseen that falsehood would become reality, and that I’d truly violated heavenly law? What can be done now? I beg you, Master, please save me!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n“Otherwise, even if I die, I won’t let you go.” Shoucheng replied, “I cannot save you myself, but I can point out a path for you to reincarnate.” The dragon said, “I humbly request your guidance.” The master continued, “Tomorrow at the third hour of noon, you are scheduled to appear before Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official, to be executed. If you truly wish to keep your life, you must quickly go and plead with Emperor Taizong of Tang, who reigns today. Wei Zheng is the chancellor under the Tang emperor; only by gaining his personal favor can you ensure safety.” Hearing this, the Dragon King bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnaware of how time had passed, the sun had already set in the west, and the moon rose high in the sky. One could see: mist condensed, mountains turned purple, crows weary as they returned home; travelers far from home sought refuge in inns. New geese perched on sandbanks by the ferry landing, and the Milky Way appeared. The watchman urged the passing of the night, while in the lonely village, lamplight flickered without flame. Smoke curled gently from hearths in quiet monasteries, and within butterfly dreams, people vanished from sight. The moon shifted, casting flower shadows onto the railing, stars twinkled wildly. The sound of dripping water marked the hours, and before one knew it, the deep night had already reached its midpoint.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King of the Jing River did not return to his underwater palace. Instead, he remained in mid-air, waiting until around midnight, when he gathered his clouds and dispersed his mists, heading straight for the entrance of the imperial palace. At that very moment, Emperor Taizong was dreaming he had stepped outside the palace gates, walking beneath the moonlit flowers. Suddenly, the Dragon King transformed into human form and knelt before him, crying out, “Your Majesty, save me! Save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong asked, “Who are you? How can I save you?” The Dragon King replied, “Your Majesty is a true dragon, while I am an ordinary dragon. Because I’ve broken heavenly law, I’m due to be executed by Your Majesty’s virtuous minister, Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. That’s why I’ve come to beg you—I implore Your Majesty to save me!”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTaizong said, “If Wei Zheng is to carry out the execution, then I can indeed save you. Go with peace of mind.” Overjoyed, the Dragon King bowed deeply in gratitude and departed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, after waking from his dream, Emperor Taizong couldn’t stop thinking about it. By dawn, at the third watch, Taizong convened court, gathering officials from both civil and military ranks. There, one could see:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSmoke veiled the Phoenix Pavilion, fragrant incense filled the Dragon Tower. Light shimmered on the vermilion throne, clouds brushed past the emerald canopy. Ruler and ministers harmonized as though they were Yao and Shun, ritual music and decorum approached the grandeur of Han and Zhou. Courtiers held lamps, palace maids fanned themselves, their reflections glowing brightly; peacock screens and Kylin halls sparkled everywhere. All cried out “Long live the Emperor!” and offered blessings for ten thousand years. Three silent whips cracked, and all bowed in ceremonial attire before the imperial crown. Palace flowers bloomed brilliantly, their heavenly fragrance filling the air; willows along the embankment swayed gently, accompanied by imperial music. Pearl curtains and jade drapes hung high, secured by golden hooks; dragon-and-phoenix fans and mountain-and-river banners adorned the royal carriage as it paused. Civil officials stood elegant and refined, military generals proud and alert. The imperial road distinguished high from low, and ranks lined up on the vermilion platform. Golden seals and purple ribbons honored three great elephants, symbolizing enduring prosperity for countless ages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce the officials had finished their greetings and dispersed into their respective groups, Emperor Taizong, with eyes like phoenixes and dragon pupils, carefully examined each one from head to toe. Among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui, and others; among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaogin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, Qin Shubao, and many more—all dignified and solemn, yet Wei Zheng, the chancellor, was conspicuously absent. Emperor Taizong summoned Xu Shiji to the throne and said, “Last night, I had a strange dream. I dreamed someone came forward to pay homage, claiming to be the Dragon King of the Jing River, who had broken heavenly law and was due to be executed by Wei Zheng, the Human Affairs Official. He begged me to save him, and I promised to do so. Yet today, Wei Zheng is nowhere to be seen among the officials assembled. Why is that?”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShiji replied, “This dream must be taken seriously. Wei Zheng will arrive shortly; Your Majesty must not let him leave the palace. Only by keeping him here for another day can we save the dragon from the dream.”\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDelighted, Emperor Taizong immediately issued an edict, ordering the imperial messenger to summon Wei Zheng to court.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeanwhile, Chancellor Wei Zheng was at home, observing the celestial signs at night, burning precious incense, when suddenly he heard the cry of cranes echoing from the nine heavens. It was an envoy sent by Heaven, bearing a golden decree from the Jade Emperor, instructing him to execute the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream at the third hour of noon. Grateful for Heaven’s grace, Wei Zheng had already fasted and bathed, testing his wisdom sword and summoning his spiritual essence within his residence, which is why he hadn’t attended court. When the imperial messenger arrived with the decree, he was overcome with fear and anxiety, yet dared not disobey the emperor’s command. Thus, he hastily dressed and belted himself, taking the decree with him as he hurried to court, where he prostrated himself before the emperor and confessed his guilt.Emperor Tang issued an edict, saying, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I hereby pardon you and declare you innocent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" At that time, the ministers had not yet adjourned the court session. However, upon hearing these words, the emperor ordered the curtains to be drawn back and dismissed the assembly, leaving only Wei Zheng behind. He was summoned to the Golden Hall and then invited into the private audience chamber, where they first discussed strategies for ensuring peace within the realm and plans for stabilizing the country.
